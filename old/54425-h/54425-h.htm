<h4><a name="To_His_Excellency" id="To_His_Excellency"><i>To His Excellency</i></a></h4>
<h3>Sr. THOMAS FAIRFAX Knight,<br />
Lord <i>FAIRFAX</i>
of
CAMERON,</h3>
<h4>CAPTAIN-GENERALL
of the Parliaments Army;<br />
And of all their Forces in <i>ENGLAND</i>, and
the Dominion of <i>WALES</i>.</h4>

<p>May it please your
<span class="smcap">Excellency</span>,</p>

<p><i>The Divine Providence hath hitherto so ordered
my life, that for the greatest part thereof, I
have lived (as it were) in exile from my native
Countrey: which happened, partly, by reason
of my education in the Romish Religion, and
that in forraign Universities; and partly,
by my entrance into Monasticall orders. For twelve years space
of which time, I was wholly disposed of in that part of</i> America
<i>called</i> New-Spain, <i>and the parts adjacent. My difficult going
thither, being not permitted to any, but to those of the Spanish
Nation; my long stay there; and lastly my returning home, not
onely to my Country, but to the true knowledg and free-profession of
the Gospels purity, gave me reason to conceive, That these great
mercies were not appointed me by the heavenly Powers, to the end I
should bury my Talent in the earth, or hide my light under a bushell,
but that I should impart what I there saw and knew to the use
and benefit of my English Country-men; And which the rather
I held my self obliged unto, because in a manner nothing hath
been written of these Parts for these hundred years last past,
which is almost ever since the first Conquest thereof by the</i> Spaniards,
<i>who are contented to lose the honour of that wealth and
felicity they have there since purchased by their great endevours,
so they may enjoy the safety of retaining what they have formerly
gotten in peace and security. In doing whereof I shall offer no
Collections, but such as shall arise from mine own observations,
which will as much differ from what formerly hath been hereupon
written, as the picture of a person grown to mans estate, from that
which was taken of him when he was but a Childe; or the last
hand of the Painter, to the first or rough draught of the picture.
I am told by others, that this may prove a most acceptable work;
but I doe tell my self that it will prove both lame and imperfect,
and therefore had need to shelter my self under the shadow of some
high protection, which I humbly pray your Excellency to afford
me; nothing doubting, but as God hath lately made your Excellency
the happy instrument, not onely of saving my self, but of many
numbers of godly and well-affected people in this County of</i> Kent,
<i>(where now I reside by the favour of the Parliament) from the
imminent ruine and destruction plotted against them by their most
implacable enemies; so the same God who hath led your Excellency
through so many difficulties towards the settlement of the peace of
this Kingdom, and reduction of</i> Ireland, <i>will, after the perfecting
thereof (which God of his mercy hasten) direct your Noble thoughts
to employ the Souldiery of this Kingdom upon such just and honourable
designes in those parts of</i> America, <i>as their want of action
at home may neither be a burden to themselves nor the Kingdome.
To your Excellency therefore I offer a</i> New-World, <i>to be the subject
of your future pains, valour, and piety, beseeching your acceptance
of this plain but faithfull relation of mine, wherein your
Excellency, and by you the English Nation shall see what wealth
and honor they have lost by one of their narrow hearted Princes,
who living in peace and abounding in riches, did notwithstanding
reject the offer of being first discoverer of</i> America; <i>and left it
unto</i> Ferdinando <i>of</i> Arragon, <i>who at the same time was wholly
taken up by the Warrs, in gaining of the City and Kingdome of</i>
Granada <i>from the</i> Moores; <i>being so impoverished thereby, that
he was compelled to borrow with some difficulty a few Crowns of a
very mean man, to set forth</i> Columbus <i>upon so glorious an expedition.
And yet, if time were closely followed at the heels, we are
not so farr behinde, but we might yet take him by the fore-top.
To which purpose, our Plantations of the</i> Barbadoes, St. Christophers,
Mems, <i>and the rest of the</i> Caribe-Islands, <i>have not
onely advanced our journey the better part of the way; but so
inured our people to the Clime of the</i> Indies, <i>as they are the more
inabled thereby to undertake any enterprise upon the firm Land
with greater facility. Neither is the difficulty of the attempt so
great, as some may imagine; for I dare be bold to affirm it knowingly,
That with the same pains and charge which they have been
at in planting one of those pettie Islands, they might have conquer'd
so many great Cities, and large Territories on the main Continent,
as might very well merit the title of a Kingdome. Our Neighbors
the</i> Hollanders <i>may be our example in this case; who whilst we
have been driving a private Trade from Port to Port, of which
we are likely now to be deprived, have conquered so much Land in
the</i> East <i>and</i> West-Indies, <i>that it may be said of them, as of the</i>
Spaniards, That the Sunn never sets upon their Dominions.
<i>And to meet with that objection by the way,</i> That the Spaniard
being intituled to those Countries, it were both unlawfull
and against all conscience to dispossess him thereof. <i>I answer,
that (the Popes donation excepted) I know no title he hath but
force, which by the same title, and by a greater force may be
repelled. And to bring in the title of</i> First-discovery; <i>to me it
seems as little reason, that the sailing of a</i> Spanish <i>Ship upon the
coast of</i> India, <i>should intitle the King of</i> Spain <i>to that Countrey,
as the sayling of an</i> Indian <i>or</i> English <i>Ship upon the coast of</i> Spain,
<i>should intitle either the</i> Indians <i>or</i> English <i>unto the Dominion
thereof. No question but the just right or title to those Countries
appertains to the Natives themselves; who, if they shall willingly
and freely invite the</i> English <i>to their protection, what title soever
they have in them, no doubt but they may legally transferr it or
communicate it to others. And to say, That the inhumane butchery
which the</i> Indians <i>did formerly commit in sacrificing of so many
reasonable Creatures to their wicked Idols, was a sufficient warrant
for the</i> Spaniards <i>to divest them of their Country; The same
argument may by much better reason be inforced against the</i> Spaniards
<i>themselves, who have sacrificed so many millions of</i> Indians
<i>to the Idol of their barbarous cruelty, that many populous Islands
and large Territories upon the main Continent, are thereby at
this day utterly uninhabited, as</i> Bartholomeo de las Casas, <i>the</i>
Spanish <i>Bishop of</i> Guaxaca <i>in</i> New-Spain, <i>hath by his Writings
in Print sufficiently testified. But to end all disputes of this nature;
since that God hath given the earth to the sons of Men to
inhabite; and that there are many vast Countries in those
parts, not yet inhabited either by</i> Spaniard <i>or</i> Indian, <i>why should
my Country-men the</i> English <i>be debarred from making use of that,
which God from all beginning no question did ordain for the
benefit of mankinde?</i></p>

<p><i>But I will not molest your Excellency with any further argument
hereupon; rather offering my self, and all my weak endevours
(such as they are) to be employed herein for the good of my
Country; I beseech Almighty God to prosper your Excellency,<br />
Who am</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The most devoted and humblest of<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">your Excellencies servants,</span></p>

AUTHOR.</a></h3>


<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Reader</i>, behold presented to thine eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What us <i>Columbus</i> off'red long agoe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the <i>New-World</i> a new discoverie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which here our Author doth so clearly show;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he the state which of these Parts would know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Need not hereafter search the plenteous store</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of <i>Hackluit, Purchas</i> and <i>Ramusio</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or learn'd <i>Acosta's</i> writings to look o're;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or what <i>Herera</i> hath us told before,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which merit not the credit due from hence,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those being but reck'nings of anothers score.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But these the fruits of self-experience:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherein our Author useth not the sence</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those at home, who doe their judgments leave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And after wandring farr with vast expence,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See many things, which they doe ne'r perceive;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laborious are by study much at home</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To know those Parts, which they came lately from.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Less doth he use us as the late writ Books</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Journeys made unto the <i>Levant</i>-States;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherein when we doe pry with curious looks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Troy</i> to know the present fates;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They tell us what <i>Thucidides</i> relates,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What <i>Strabo</i> writes, what <i>Homer</i> crown'd with bayes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What Authors more, who have out-worn their daies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Besides what <i>Plutarch</i> and <i>Polibius</i> sayes:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So what they were, not what they are, they sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shew their reading, not their travailing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But here our Author neither doth us tell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or to us shew one inch of Sea or Ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unless such acts which in his time befell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or what his eyes saw the Horizon bound:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He uttereth nought at all he heard by sound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He speaks not of a City or a Street,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But where himself hath often gone the round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And measured o're with his industrious feet.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet it must acknowledg'd be for true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since worthy <i>Hawkins</i>, and the famous <i>Drake</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did first present unto the English view</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This New-found-world, for great <i>Eliza's</i> sake;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Renowned <i>Rawleigh</i> twice did undertake</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With labours great, and dangers not a few,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A true discovery of these Parts to make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thereof writ both what he saw and knew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as the man who in a Ship doth pass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our narrow Seas, the flowings of each tide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Ships course, soundings, turnings of the glass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What Land he makes on North or Southern side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He may impart: But who they be abide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or what Religion, Language, or what Nation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Possess each Coast; since he hath never tride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How can he make thereof a true Relation?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So those who have describ'd these Parts before,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Trade, Winds, Currents, Hurican's doe tell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Headlands, Harbours, tendings of the shore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Rocks and Isles: wherein they might as well</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Talk or a Nut, and onely shew the shell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kernell neither tasted, touch'd nor seen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had yet remain'd; but that it so befell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That these Relations to us made have been;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Differing as much from what before y'have heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As doth a Land-Map from a Seamans Card.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But how these truths reveal'd to us should bee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When none but <i>Spaniards</i> to those Parts may go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which was establish'd by severe Decree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lest Forain people should their secrets know;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This Order yet to be neglected so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As that our Author had permission free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose Nation too they count their greatest foe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemeth almost a miracle to me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sure the prescience of that power Divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which safely to those parts did him convey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not for nought his constant heart incline</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There twelve whole years so patiently to stay:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he each thing exactly might survay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then him return'd, nay more did turn to us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to him shew'd of bliss the perfect way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which of the rest seems most miraculous.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For had the last of these not truly been,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These fair Relations we had never seen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor can I think but this most usefull Book</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In time to come, may like some new-born Starr,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Direct such Wisemen as therein will look,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shew their way unto these Regions farr.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though we now lie sunk in Civill war,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet you the worthy Patriots of this Land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let not your hearts be drowned in despair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so your future happiness withstand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For time will come you shall enjoy a Peace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But then no longer you must joy in sinn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they no more shall raign, these Wars shall cease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then your after bliss shall soon beginn.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fiery trialls which you now are in,</span><br />

WEST-INDIES.</a></h2>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<h4><i>How Rome doth yearly visit the American and Asian Kingdoms.</i></h4>


<p>The policy, which for many yeares hath upheld the erring
Church of <i>Rome</i>, hath clearly and manifestly been discovered by the
many Errors which in severall times by sundry Synods
or Generall Councells, (which commonly are but
Apes of the Popes fancy, will, pleasure, and ambition) have
been enacted into that Church. And for such purposes doth
that man of Sinne, and Antichristian tyrant, keep constantly
in <i>Rome</i> so many poor Pensionary Bishops as hounds at his
table, smelling out his ambitious thoughts, with whom he fills
the Synods, when he calls them, charging them never to leave off barking and wearying
out the rest of the Prelates, untill they have them all as a prey unto his proud and ambitious
designes; from which if any of them dare to start, not onely their Pensions shall
be surely forfeited, but their souls shall bee cursed, and they as Hereticks Anathematized
with a Censure of Excommunication <i>latæ sententiæ</i>. Hence sprung that Master-piece of
Policy, decreeing that the Pope alone should be above the Generall Councell, lest otherwise
one Mans pride might be curbed by many heads joyned together; And secondly,
that Synodicall definition, that the Pope cannot erre, that though the Councels power,
wisdome and learning were all sifted into one mans brain, all points of faith straitned
into one head and channell; yet the People should not stagger in any lawfull doubts,
nor the learned sort follow any more the light of reason, or the sunshine of the Gospel,
but all yeelding to blind Obedience, and their most holy Fathers infallibility, in the
foggie and Cimmerian mist of ignorance, might secure their souls from erring, or deviating
to the <i>Scylla</i> or <i>Charybdis</i> of Schism and Heresie. What judicious eye, that will
not be blinded with the napkin of ignorance, doth not easily see that Policy only hath
been the chief Actor of those damnable Opinions of Purgatory, Transubstantiation,
Sacrifice though unbloody (as they term it) of the Mass, Invocation of Saints, their Canonization
or installing of Saints into the kingdom of heaven, Indulgences, auricular Confession,
with satisfactory Penance, and many such like: All which doubtles have been commanded
as points of Faith, not so much to save those wretched souls, as to advance that
crackt-brain head in the conceits of his Europæan wonderers, who long agoe were
espyed out by the Spirit of <i>John</i> wondring after the Beast, worshipping him for his
power, and saying, <i>Who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make warre with him?</i> Revel. 13.
3, 4. Thus can Policy invent a Purgatory, that a Pope may be sought from all parts of
<i>Europe</i>, nay now from East and West <i>India's</i>, to deliver souls from that imaginary Fire
which never God created, but he himself hath fancyed, that so much glory may be ascribed
to him, and his power wondered at, who can plunge into torments, condemn to
burning, and when he list, deliver out of fire. Much more would he be admired, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
goodnesse extolled, if he would deliver at once all those his Purgatory Prisoners without
that Simoniacall receipt of money. But policy can afford an infinite price and value
of a sacrifice of the Masse, to delude the ignorant people, that though they leave their
whole estates to enrich Cloysters, and fat proud Prelates and Abbots; yet this is nothing,
and comes farre short (being finite) to that infinite Sacrifice, which onely can and
must deliver their scorching, nay broyling souls: And if this infinite Sacrifice be not
enough, (which will not be enough, whereas Christs infinit satisfaction was not enough
in the opinion in that erroneous Church) Policy will give yet power to a Pope <i>si divitiæ
affluant</i>, if money and rich bribes abound, to grant such plenary Indulgences, which
may upon one Saints day, or at such a Saints Altar, work that soul out, which
lyeth lurking and frying in the deepest pit of Purgatory. O who is like unto the
Beast? But will those that wonder at him, bee also wondred at as workers of
wonders and miracles? Policy will give power to a Pope to canonize such, and
set them at Gods right hand, fit to be prayed unto, and called upon as Judges of our
necessities, and Auditors of our wants: But this honor must be given, after that the
whole Colledge of Cardinalls have been clothed with new Purple Robes, and Loads
of money brought to the Court of <i>Rome</i>; Witness those many thousand pounds,
which the City of <i>Barcelona</i>, and the whole Country of <i>Catalonia</i> spent in the Canonizing
of <i>Raimundus de Pennafort</i>, a Dominican Fryer: Witnesse at least ten Millions, which
I have been credibly informed, that the Jesuites spent for the canonization of their two
Twins, <i>Ignatius Loiola</i>, and <i>Franciscus Xavier</i>, whom they call the East <i>India</i> Apostle.
And it is not seven years ago yet that it was my chance to travail from <i>Frankford</i> in <i>Germany</i>
as far as <i>Millan</i> in company of one Fryer <i>John Baptist</i> a <i>Franciscan</i>, who told me,
That was the fourth time of his going to <i>Rome</i> from <i>Valencia</i> in the Kingdome of <i>Arragon</i>
in <i>Spain</i> about the Canonization of one <i>John Capistrano</i> of the same Order; and that
besides the great Almes which he had begged over many Countreys, (and in that journey
went purposely to <i>Inspurg</i> to the Prince <i>Leopoldo</i> for his Almes and Letters of commendation
to the Pope and Cardinals) he had spent of the City of <i>Valencia</i> onely five thousand
Duckets, and yet was not his Saint enthroned, as he desired, in heaven; But still
money was wanting, and more demanded for the dignifying with a Saints title him, who
had lived a Mendicant and begging Frier. Thus are those blinded Nations brought by
Policy to run to <i>Rome</i> with rich treasures, and thus doe they strive who shall have most
Saints of their Countrey or Nation, though impoverishing themselves; whilst at <i>Rome</i>
ambition and Policy say not, It is enough, fit mates for the Horsleech his two daughters,
crying, <i>Give, give, Prov.</i> 30. 15. Give, say they, and the rigid Penance justly to be imposed
upon thee for thy sinnes most hainous, shall be extenuated and made easie for thee.
Give, say they, and thou shalt be dispensed with to marry thy nearest Kinswoman or
Kinsman. It would be a long story to insert here how the Popes Policy sucks out of
<i>England</i> our gold and silver for the authorizing of our Papists private Chambers and
Altars for the gaining of Indulgences in them, and delivering of souls out of Purgatory,
when Masses are said and heard at them. Thus hath <i>Romes</i> policy blinded and deceived
many of the <i>European</i> Kingdomes; and with the same greedinesse gapes at <i>Asia</i> and
<i>America</i>. Who would not admire to see that at this day in <i>America</i> onely, the Popes
authority and usurped power is extended to as many Countreys as all <i>Europe</i> containes,
wherein no Religion but meer blinde Obedience and subjection to that Man of Sin is
known? And daily may it more and more encrease, whereas the King of <i>Spain</i> gloryeth
to have received from the Pope power over those Kingdomes farr greater than any other
Princes of <i>Europe</i> have enjoyed from him. But the pity is, that what power these Princes
have, they must acknowledge it from <i>Rome</i>, having given their own power and strength
unto the Beast, <i>Revel.</i> 17. 13. suffering themselves to be divested of any Ecclesiasticall
power over the Clergy, and unabled to tender any Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance to
their own and naturall subjects, onely so farre as his Holinesse shall give them power.
Which, Policy since the first Conquest of the West <i>India's</i>, and ambition to advance
the Popes name, hath granted to the Kings of <i>Spain</i>, by a speciall title, naming those
Kingdomes, <i>El Patrimonio Real</i>, The Royall Patrimony; upon this Condition, that
the King of <i>Spain</i> must maintain there the preaching of the Gospel, Fryers, Priests and
Jesuites to preach it with all the erroneous Popish doctrines, which tend to the advancement
of the Popes glory, power, and authority. So that what power hee hath divested
himself of, and invested the Pope with; what power other Princes are divested of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the King of <i>Spain</i> in his Kingdomes of <i>Europe</i>, from medling in Ecclesiasticall affaires,
or with Ecclesiasticall men; Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Preists, Jesuites, Monkes and
Fryers; that same power by way of Royall Patrimony is conferred upon him in the
<i>India's</i> only. And this only politickly to maintain there Popery; else never would it have
so much increased there; for poor Preists and mendicant Fryers would never have had
means enough to be at the charges of sending yeerly Flockes and Sholes of Fryers thither,
neither to keep and maintain them there; neither would the covetousnesse of
the Popes themselves have afforded out of their full and rich treasures, means sufficient
for the maintaning of so many thousand Preachers as at this day are preaching there,
more <i>Rome</i> and Antichrists name, then the name of Christ and the truth of the Gospel.
And policy having thus opened way to those <i>American</i> parts, the charges thus being
laid upon the Crown of <i>Spain</i>, and the honour of a Royall Patrimony, with power
over the Clergy thus conferred upon the Kings of <i>Spain</i>, how doth the Pope yeerly
charge the Catholike King with troopes of Jesuites and Fryers to be conveyed thither?
Now the Jesuites (the best scholars of <i>Romes</i> policy) seeing this to bee thus
setled between the Pope and the King of <i>Spain</i>, for the increasing of their
Order, and to suppresse the increase of other Religions there, have thought first of a way of challenging
all the <i>India's</i> to themselves, alleadging that <i>Francis Xavierius</i> companion of
<i>Ignatius Loiola</i> was the first Preacher that ever preached in the <i>East India's</i>, and so by
right that they being of his profession ought only to be sent thither. But this their way
being stopped by the opposition of all other Religious orders, especially by the solicitation
of one Fryer <i>Diego Colliado</i>, a Dominican, as hereafter I will shew more largely:
Now, secondly, their policy is to leane more to the Popes of <i>Rome</i>, then any other
of those Orders, by a speciall Vow which they make above the three Vowes of other
orders, Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience to their superiors; to wit, to be alwaies
ready to go to preach when or whither soever the Pope shall send them, and to advance
his name, defend his power in what parts soever, maugre whatsoever danger, or opposition.
Thus though the remotenesse of <i>America</i> may discourage other Orders from
going thither to preach, and their freewill which is left unto them to make choice of
so long and tedious a journey may retard their readinesse, and the dangers of the <i>Barbarians</i>
unwillingnesse to submit to a Popes power, and admit of a new Religion as superstitious
as their own, may affright them from hazarding their lives among a barbarous,
rude, and idolatrous people; yet if all others faile, the Pope, and the Jesuites
being thus agreed, and the King of <i>Spain</i> bound by the new Royall Patrimony,
Preachers have nor, nor shall ever be wanting in those parts: And in stead of the old
Jesuites and Preachers grown in age, yeerly are sent thither Missions (as they call
them) either of Voluntiers, Fryers mendicants, Preists or Monkes, or else of forced
Jesuites: All which entring once into the List and Bond of Missionaries, must abide
there, and be maintained by the King of <i>Spain</i> ten yeers. And whosoever before the
ten yeers expired, shall desire to see <i>Spain</i> again, or runagate-like shall return, may be
constrained (if taken in <i>Spain</i>) to return again to the <i>India's</i>, as it happened whilst
I lived in those parts, to one Fryer <i>Peter de Balcazar</i> a Dominican, who privily flying
back to <i>Spain</i>, was the year after shipped, and restored again to his forced service
under the Pope of <i>Rome</i>. And thus doth policy open the wayes to those remote and
forain parts of <i>America</i>. Thus hath policy wrought upon the Kings of <i>Spain</i>; and
Jesuiticall policy meeting with Antichrists policy and Ambition, doth <i>Rome</i> yeerly
visit her new nursed Children, greeting that Infantile Church of <i>Asia</i> and <i>America</i> with
troopes of messengers one after another, like <i>Jobs</i> messengers, bringing under pretence
of salvation, damnation and misery to their poor and wretched souls.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing that the</i> Indians <i>wealth under a pretence of their Conversion hath corrupted
the hearts of poor begging Fryers, with strife, hatred and ambition.</i></h4>


<p>It is a most true and certain saying, <i>Odia Religionum sunt acerbissima</i>, hatred grounded
in points and differences of Religion (let me adde, if ambition blow the fire to
that hatred) is the most bitter and uncapable of reconciliation. Nay, it is an observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
worth noting of some (see Doctor <i>Day</i> upon the I <i>Cor.</i> 16. 9. Verse) that the
neerer any are unto a conjunction in matters of Religion, and yet some difference retained,
the deeper is the hatred; As hee observes, a Jew hates a Christian farre worse
then hee doth a Pagan, or a Turke; a Papist hates a Protestant worse then hee doth
a Jew, and a Formalist hates a Puritan worse then hee doth a Papist. No such hatred
under heaven (saith hee) as that between a Formalist, and a Puritan, whereof our
now Domestick and Civill Warres may bee a sad and woefull experience. A truth
which made <i>Paul</i> burst out into a lamentable complaint, I <i>Cor.</i> 16. 9. saying, <i>A great
doore and effectuall is opened unto mee, and there are many adversaries</i>.</p>

<p>And as when the doore of true Faith once is opened, then Adversaries begin to
swarme and rage; so in all points of false and fained Religion where the entrance to
it is laid open, hatred and enmity will act their parts. But much more if with such
pretended Religion, Wealth and Ambition as counterfeit Mates thrust hard to enter
at the opened doore, what strife, hatred, and envy doe they kindle even in the hearts
of such who have vowed poverty and the contempt of worldly wealth? I may adde
to what hath beene observed above, that no hatred is comparable to that which is betweene
a Jesuite and a Fryer, or any other of <i>Romes</i> Religious Orders; And above all
yet betweene a Jesuite, and a Dominican. The ambition and pride of Jesuites is inconsistent
in a Kingdome or Common-wealth with any such as may bee equall to them
in Preaching, Counsell or Learning. Therefore strive they so much for the education
of Gentlemens Children in their Colledges, that by teaching the sonnes, the love of
the fathers and mothers may bee more easily gained: and their love and good will
thus gained, they may withall gaine to themselves whatsoever praise, honour, glory
may bee fit to bee bestowed upon any other Ecclesiasticall Person. Which Policy
and Ambition in them being so patent and knowne to all the World, hath stirred up in
all other Religions a hatred to them uncapable ever of Reconciliation. This hath
made them all to conspire against them, and to discover their unsatisfied covetousnesse
in beguiling the rich widowes of what meanes hath beene left them by their deceased
husbands, to erect and build those stately Colledges beyond the Seas, the sight whereof
both outward and inward doth draw the ignorant people to resort more to their
Churches and preaching then to any other. Thus whilest in <i>Venice</i>, they got the favour
of one of the chief Senatours of that Common-wealth, they politickly drew
him to make his will according to their will and pleasure, leaving to his son and heire
no more then what they should think fit to afford him. But they appropriating to themselves
the chiefest part of the young heires meanes, and with so proud a legacy thinking
to overpower all other Orders, were by them opposed so, that the Will was called
for by the whole State and Senatours of <i>Venice</i>, fully examined, and they commanded
to restore to the heire the whole Estate as enjoyed by his Father. Well did that wise
Senate conceive, that as one Noble man had been cheated by them of his fortunes, so
might they one by one, and so at length the riches of <i>Venice</i> might become a treasure
onely for Jesuites to maintaine the pride and pompe of their glorious fabricks. And
though those vowed servants to the Pope obtained his Excommunication against the
whole Estate of <i>Venice</i> upon non-complying with the foresaid Will and Testament;
yet such was the preaching of all other Preists and Orders against them, that they
caused the State to slight the Excommunication, and in lieu of making them heires of
the deceased Senatours Estate, they shamefully banished them out of <i>Venice</i>. Thus also
have the Preists and Fryers of <i>Biscaya</i> in <i>Spain</i> prevailed against the admitting of Jesuits
into <i>San-Sebastian</i>, though by the favour of some they have in severall occasions obtained
an house and erected a Bell to ring and summon in the People to their pretended
Church and Colledge. Nay the very house wherein their Patron <i>Ignatius Loiola</i> lived,
have they often seriously offered to buy for a Colledge; yet such hath been the opposition
of the Preists and Fryers of that Countrey, that they have dashed to nought
their often iterated endeavours to purchase that which they esteem their chiefest Relique.
But to come neerer to our owne Countrey, what a combustion did this strife betweene
Jesuites and other Preists of <i>England</i> cause among our Papists ten yeares agoe, when
the Pope sending into <i>England</i> Doctor <i>Smith</i> pretended Bishop of <i>Chalcedon</i> to bee the
Metropolitan head over all the Clergy and other Orders, how then was it to see
the pride of the Jesuites as inconsistent with any one that might oversway them, or gain
more credit then themselves? who never left persecuting the Bishop, till by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Popes Letters they had banished him out of <i>England</i>. Which curtesie, the secular Preists
gaining yet a head over them with title of Archdeacon, Doctor <i>Champney</i>, have ever
since sought to repay home, by endeavouring alwayes to cast them out of <i>England</i>,
as pernicious to the State of this Kingdome, more then Fryers or any other sort of
Preists; Which they have sufficiently made known by discovering their covetousnesse
in encroaching upon many Houses and Farmes, enriching themselves, as namely at
<i>Winifreds</i> Well (so tearmed by them) where they had bought an Inne; and speedily
fell to building there that they might make it a Colledge for Jesuites to entertaine there
all Papists comers and goers to that Well, and so might win to themselves the hearts
of most of the Papists of the Land, who doe yearly resort thither to bee washed and
healed upon any light occasion either of Head-ach, Stomack-ach, Ague, want of
children, where they blindly phansie a speedy remedy for all maladies, or wants of
this World. Thus have the Preists discovered further our English Jesuites covetousnesse
in the building of the Sope-houses at <i>Lambeth</i> under the name of Mr. <i>George Gage</i>
their purse-bearer, and since projecting the Monopoly of Sope under Sir <i>Richard Weston</i>,
Sir <i>Basil Brooke</i>, and many others names, who were but Agents and Traders with the
Jesuites rich and mighty Stocke. Thus came out the discovery of the Levelling of
Hils and Mountaines, cutting of rocks at <i>Leige</i> in the Low Countryes at the Colledge
of the English Jesuites, a worke for Gardens and Orchards for their Novices recreation
and pastime, which (as I have heard from their owne mouthes) cost them thirty
thousand pound, which gift they squeezed out of one onely Countesse of this Land.
Like to this may prove their Colledge at <i>Gaunt</i>, for which they have obtained already
a faire beginning of eight thousand pounds from the Old Countesse of <i>Shrewsberry</i>,
and from the greatest part of the Estate of Mr. <i>Sackefield</i>, whom whilst they had him
in their Colledges, they cherished with their best dainties, and with hopes that one
day hee should bee a Canonized Saint of their Religious Order. All these knaveries doe
even those Preists of the same Popish Religion discover of them, and thereby endeavor
to make them odious. And though of all, the Jesuites be the most covetous, yet may
I not excuse the Secular Preists, Benedictine Monks, and the Fryers from this damnable
sinne; who also strive for wealth and meanes for their <i>Doway, Paris</i> and <i>Lisboe</i>
Colledges, and lose no opportunities at the death of their Popish favourites for the
obtaining a Legacy of one or two hundred Pounds, assuring them their soules shall bee
the better for their Masses. Thus doe those miserable wretches in the very heat of their
zeale of soules seeke to suppresse one another, and having vowed Poverty, yet make
they the Conversion of <i>England</i> the onely object of their Ambition and unsatiable
Covetousnesse. But above all is this envy and hatred found between Dominicans and
Jesuites, for these owe unto them an old grudge, for that when <i>Ignatius Loiola</i> lived, his
Doctrine <i>de Trinitate</i> (which hee pretended was revealed to him from heaven, for
hee was certainely past the Age of studying at his Conversion) was questioned by the
Dominicans, and hee by a Church Censure publickly and shamefully whipped about
their Cloisters for his erroneous principles. This affront done to their chief Patron
hath stirred up in them an unreconciliable hatred towards the Order of the Dominicans,
and hath made them even cracke their braines to oppose <i>Thomas Aquinas</i> his Doctrine.
How shamefully doe those two Orders indeavour the destruction of each other, branding
one another with calumnies of heresie in the Opinions especially <i>de Conceptione
Mariæ, de libero arbitrio, de Auxiliis</i>? And of the two, the Jesuites is more bold and obstinate
in malice and hatred. How did they some twenty yeares agoe, all <i>Spaine</i> over, about
the Conception of <i>Mary</i> stirre up the people against the Dominicans, in so much
that they were in the very streets tearmed Hereticks, stones cast at them, the King almost
perswaded to banish them out of all his Dominions, and they poore Fryers forced to
stand upon their Guard in their Cloisters in many Cities, especially in <i>Sevill, Osuna,
Antiquera</i> and <i>Cordova</i>, to defend themselves from the rude and furious multitude. Much
like this was that publike Conference and disputation betweene <i>Valentia</i> the Jesuite and
Master <i>Lemos</i> the Dominican, before the Pope, concerning their altercation <i>de Auxiliis</i>;
When the cunning Jesuite hoping to brand with heresie the whole Order of Dominicans,
had caused <i>Augustines</i> Workes to bee falsly printed at <i>Lions</i>, with such words
which might directly oppose the <i>Thomists</i> Opinion; and had prevailed, had not <i>Lemos</i>
begged of the Pope that the Originall Bookes of <i>Augustin</i> might bee brought out of his Vatican
Library, where was found the quite contrary words, to what the false Jesuite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
had caused to be printed; hee was forced to confesse his knavery, was harshly reprehended,
and with the apprehension of that great affront, the next night gave up his
ghost to his father, the father of lies and falshood.</p>

<p>An other reason of this mortall enmity between these two Orders, is for that the
Jesuites surpasse all others in ambition or honour, credit, and estimation, whence
it is they cannot indure to behold the Dominicans to exceed them in any preferment.
Now it is that by the Laws of <i>Arragon</i> and the Kingdome of <i>Valencia</i>, the Kings of
<i>Spain</i> are tied to have a Dominican Fryer for their Confessor or ghostly father; which
could but the Jesuites obtain, how would they then rule and govern <i>Spain</i> and the
Kings heart? But though they could never yet prevail to alter this established law, yet
have they prevailed now lately so that <i>Antonio de Sotomayor</i> the King of <i>Spains</i> Confessor
should lie at rest in the Court of <i>Madrid</i>, with a pension and dry title only;
and that <i>Florencia</i> that grand Statist should be Confessor to the Count of <i>Olivares</i>, the
Royall Issue, the Queen, and should hear the Kings confessions oftner then his chosen
and elected Confessor <i>Sotomayor</i>. Secondly, the Dominicans as first Authors of the Inquisition
(which they prove from their Martyr <i>Peter</i> of <i>Verona</i>) still enjoy the highest
places of that Court, which is a wofull sight to the Jesuites to see their Religion affaires
handled, their Church kept pure from what they call heresy by any but themselves.
O had they (as they have often strived for it) in their hands the judicature
of that tribunall, how should all Dominicans, nay all sorts of Preists but their own,
presently by them be branded with heresy? Thirdly, in <i>Rome</i> there is an other preferment
successively due to Dominicans, from the time of <i>Dominicus de Guzman</i> founder
of that Religion, to wit, to be <i>magister Sacri Palatii</i>, the Popes Palace master, instituted to
this purpose that about him there may be some learned Divine (for commonly the
Popes are more Statists, and Canonists, then Divines) to read a daily lecture of Divinity
to such as will be instructed therein, and to resolve the Pope himselfe of whatsoever difficult
points in Divinity may be questioned. This is the Dominicans due with a pension
to maintain Coach and servants within the Palace of <i>St. Peter</i>. Which the Jesuites
have often by favour and cunning Jesuiticall trickes endeavoured to bereave the Dominicans
of; but proving labour in vain, they continue still in their unplacable enmity
and hatred against them. And thus you see the fountaines of their strife; which as
here in <i>Europe</i> hath been well seen, so hath this contentious fire overpowered the fire of
their zeal of soules in the <i>East</i> and <i>West-India's</i>; and the wealth and riches of those
Countries, the ambition of honor in their Gospel function hath more powerfully
drawn them thither, then (what they pretend) the Conversion of a barbarous and idolatrous
nation. This was well published to the view of the whole world by a most infamous
libel which in the year 1626 fryer <i>Diego di Colliado</i> a missionary Fryer in <i>Philippinas</i>
and <i>Japan</i> set out of the unheard of passages and proceedings of the Jesuites in those
<i>Eastern</i> parts. At that time the Jesuites pretended that mission to themselves only, and
petitioned the King of <i>Spain</i>, that only they might go thither to preach, having been
the first plantation of <i>Franciscus Xavier</i>, and since continued successively by their
Preists. To this purpose they remembred the King of the great charges he was at in
sending so many Fryers and maintaining them there; all which should be saved, might
they only have free ingresse into those Kingdomes. All which charges they offered
themselves to beare, and further to bring up the <i>Indians</i> in the true faith, to instruct
them and civilize them, to teach them all liberall sciences, and to perfect them in musick
and all musicall instruments, and in fencing, dancing, vaulting, painting and whatsoever
els might make them a compleat, and civill people. But against all this was objected
by <i>Diego Colliado</i>, that not zeal only and charity moved them to this offer, but their
ambition and covetousnesse, which would soon be seen in their encroaching upon the
silly and simple <i>Indians</i> wealth, bringing instances of many thousand pounds which
they had squeezed from the poore <i>Barbarians</i> in the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i>; And that
their entring into <i>Japan</i> was more to enrich themselves, then to convert the <i>Japonians</i>
to Christianisme; that whensoever they entred into that Kingdome they conveyed from
<i>Manila</i> whole ships laden with the richest commodities of those Islands; that their trading
was beyond all other Merchants trading, their Bench for exchange mony farre
more accustomed then any other whither for <i>China</i>, for <i>Japan</i>, for <i>Peru</i> and <i>Mexico</i>;
and that the Viceroy himselfe made use of none other, but theirs. That to keep out
all other orders out of <i>Japan</i>, they had ingratiated themselves so farre, under pretence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of trading, into the Emperours favour by gifts of Watches, Clocks, Dials, Lockes,
and Cabinets, and such like presents of most curious and artificiall Workmanship, that
they had got free accesse to his Court, and counselled him to beware of Fryers, which
cunningly crept into his Kingdome to preach a new law, perswading him by rigorous
search and enquiries to root them out: thus politickly for their own ends hindering the
increase of Christianisme by any means or instruments save themselves; and blinding
the Emperors eyes with their cunning insinuations, that he might not see in them, what
they desired he might discover in others, that they might appear in sheep skins, and
others clothed with wolves skins; and so the Fryers might have little heart to trade,
but enough to doe to save themselves from the stormy persecution, whilst they freely
might enjoy the liberty of rich trading. This brand upon these cunning foxes was
commanded to be printed, thankes given to <i>Diego Colliado</i> for discovering to the Estate
their crafty proceedings, with not a few tenents maintained by them in <i>Japan</i> even against
their owne Soveraigne; a fat Bishoprick was offered to the Fryer, which he refusing,
commission was given unto him for the raising of forty Fryers out of <i>Spain</i>, and
the conducting of them to the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i>, and that it should be free for all
Preists and Fryers, as well as Jesuites, to passe to those parts for the preaching of Christ
and the extending of Christianisme among the Heathens and Barbarians. O that this
my discovery made to <i>England</i> of those dissembling and false Preists, would make us
wise to know and discover under the ashes of their pretended Religion, the fire of strife
and contention which they kindle in Kingdomes, and to rake up that covetousnesse,
which we may easily find in them; tending to the ruine of many fair estates, and to the
temporall and spirituall danger of this our flourishing Kingdome!</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_III" id="CHAP_III">CHAP. III.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing the manner of the Missions of Fryers and Jesuites to the</i>
India's.</h4>


<p>All the Kingdomes of <i>America</i>, that have been conquered by the Kings of <i>Spain</i>,
are divided as into severall temporall governments, so into severall spirituall jurisdictions,
under the name of Provinces, belonging unto severall religious Orders, and their
Provincials. These though so farre distant from <i>Europe</i>, yet live with a dependency
and subordination unto the Court of <i>Rome</i>, and are bound to send thither a
strict account and relation of what most remarkable passages and successes happen
there, as also what want of Preachers there is in every severall Province. Which is to
be performed in this manner. Every religious Order (except the Jesuites and Dominicans,
whose Generall continueth till death, unlesse a Cardinals cap be bestowed
upon him) maketh election of one of the same order to be the head Ruler, or (as
they call him) Generall over all those of the same profession every sixth year. The subjects
unto this Generall which are dispersed in <i>Italy, Germany, Flanders, France, Spain, East</i>
and <i>West-India's</i> are divided into sundry Provinces, as in <i>Spain</i> there is one Province of
<i>Andaluzia</i>, another of <i>Castilia nueva</i>, new Castile, another of <i>Castilia vieja</i>, old
Castile, another of <i>Valencia</i>, another of <i>Arragon</i>, of <i>Murcia</i>, of <i>Catalonia</i>; So
likewise in <i>America</i> there is the Province of <i>Mexico</i>, of <i>Mechoacan</i>, of <i>Guaxaca</i>, of <i>Chiapa</i>
and <i>Guatemala</i>, of <i>Comayagua, Nicaragua</i> and the like. Every Province of these
hath a head named the Provinciall, chosen by the chief of the Province every three
years; which election is called a Provinciall Chapter, and the former a Generall Chapter,
which also is allotted to be in some chief City, commonly in <i>Italy, France</i>, or <i>Spain</i>.
When the Provinciall Chapter is kept, then by the consent of all that meet in it is there
one named by name of Procurator or Diffinitor, who is to goe in the name of the
whole Province to the next election of the Generall, and there to demand such things
as his Province shall think fit, and to give an account of the State of the Province from
whence he is sent. Thus from the <i>West-India's</i> are sent Procurators, who commonly
are the best prizes the <i>Holland</i> Ships meet with, for that they carry with them great
wealth, and gifts to the Generalls, to the Popes and Cardinals and Nobles in <i>Spain</i>,
as bribes to facilitate whatsoever just or unjust, right or wrong they are to demand.
Among other businesses their charge is this, to make known the great want of laborers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in the aboundant and plentifull harvest of the <i>India's</i> (though not all Provinces
demand Preachers from <i>Spain</i>, as I will shew hereafter) and to desire a number of
thirty or forty young Preists, who may be fit for any <i>Indian</i> language and to succeed
the old standers.</p>

<p>The Order of the Province being read to the Generall, or his Generall Chapter, then
are Letters Patents granted unto this Procurator from the Generall, naming him his
Vicar Generall for such a Province, and declaring his sufficiency and worthy parts,
(though none at all in him, as I have beene witnesse of some) the great paines hee
hath taken in the new planted <i>Indian</i> Church, and how fit hee hath been judged to
convey to those parts, a Million of such as shall voluntarily offer themselves for the propagation
of Christianity amongst those Barbarians. Then the tauny <i>Indian</i> Fryer being
well set out with high Commendations, and fairly painted with flattering Elogies,
presents these his Patents (and with them peradventure a little wedge of Gold, a Box
of Pearles, some Rubies or Diamonds, a Chest of Cochinill, or Sugar, with some boxes
of curious Chocolatte, or some feather works of <i>Mechoacan</i>, some small fruits of his
great paines and labour) to the Pope; who for his first reward gives him his Toe and
Pantofle to kisse, seconding this honour with a joyfull countenance to behold an Apostle,
judging him worthy of the best of the <i>Indian</i> wealth, and his soule peradventure
fit for the title of a Saint; This complacency in the gift and the giver, breeds immediately
a <i>motus proprius</i> in his Holinesse to grant a Bull with a degree of the Popes
Commissary, wherein this poore Mendicant Fryer is inabled to runne over all the
Cloisters of his Profession in <i>Spain</i>, to gather up his thirty or forty yong Preachers.
Who for their better encouragement are at their first listing by the Popes Authority absolved
<i>à culpa et à poena</i>, from all sinne, and from their Purgatory and Hell due unto it,
by a plenary Indulgence. And whosoever shall oppose, or any way discourage this Popes
Commissary, or those that are or would be listed by him, are <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicated
with an Anathem reserved only to this Commissary or his Holiness himself. O what is it
to see, when such a Commissaries coming is knowen, how the young birds, that as in
Cages are shut up within the walls of a Cloister, leap and cherish themselves with hopes
of liberty? What is it to see disordered Fryers, who for their misdemeanours, and
leaping over their Cloister wals in the night to find out their wanton harlots, have
been imprisoned, now rejoyce at the coming of a Popes Commissary, and Plenary
Indulgence, freeing them from sinnes past, and fitting them for the Conversion of souls,
though there be not one averted from their Harlot, nor as yet truly and unfainedly converted
to the love of God? True it is, I have knowne some that have written their
names in the list of <i>Indian Missionaries</i>, men of sober life and Conversation, moved
onely with a blind zeale of encreasing the Popish Religion: yet I dare say and confidently
print this truth without wronging the Church of <i>Rome</i>, that of thirty or forty
which in such occasions are commonly transported to the <i>India's</i>, the three parts of
them are Fryers of leud lives, weary of their retired Cloister lives, who have beene
punished often by their Superiours for their wilfull back-sliding from that obedience
which they formerly vowed; or for the breach of their poverty in closely retaining
money by them to Card and Dice, of which sort I could here namely insert a long
and tedious Catalogue; or lastly such, who have been imprisoned for violating their
vow of chastity with leud and lascivious women, either by secret flight from
their Cloisters, or by publike Apostatizing from their Order, and cloathing themselves in
Lay-mens Apparell, to run about the safer with their wicked Concubines. Of which
sort it was my chance to bee acquainted with one Fryer <i>John Navarro</i> a Franciscan in
the City of <i>Guatemala</i>, who after hee had in secular apparell enjoyed the leud company
of one <i>Amaryllis</i> a famous Woman player in <i>Spain</i> for the space of a year, fearing
at last hee might bee discovered, listed himselfe in a Million to <i>Guatemala</i>, the year
1632, there hoping to enjoy with more liberty and lesse feare of punishment any lustfull
or carnfull object. Liberty, in a word, under the Cloak of Piety and Conversion
of Soules, it is, that drawes so many Fryers (and commonly the younger sort) to
those remote <i>American</i> parts; where after they have learned some <i>Indian</i> language,
they are licenced with a Parish Charge to live alone out of the sight of a watching
Prior or Superiour, out of the bounds and compasse of Cloister walls, and authorized
to keep house by themselves, and to finger as many Spanish Patacones, as their
wits device shall teach them to squeeze out of the newly Converted <i>Indians</i> wealth. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
liberty they could never injoy in <i>Spain</i>, and this liberty is the Midwife of so many foule
falls of wicked Fryers in those parts. For the present onely, I shall return again to my
Fryer <i>John Navarro</i>, who at his comming to <i>Guatemala</i>, being made for his wit and learning,
Master and Reader of Divinity, and much esteemed of for his acute Preaching, among
many others got the estimation and love of a chief Gentlewoman, (<i>Qua semel est
imbuta recens servabit odorem, testa diu</i>) who continued in <i>Navarro</i> his heart the former sent
of the unchast love of <i>Amaryllis</i>, so far that the Fryer being blinded and wounded with
<i>Cupids</i> Arrow sticking in his heart, ran headlong to quench his lustfull thirst upon St.
<i>James</i> his day, 1635. for bitter memory of the Tragical event (being the Spaniards common
Advocate, and speciall Patron of that City, named <i>St. Jago de Guatemala</i>) where cruell
<i>Mars</i> oppressing <i>Venus</i> in her wanton Acts, the injured husband acting <i>Mars</i>, &amp; finding
<i>Navarro Cupids</i> page saluting his <i>Venus</i> upon her bed, drew his sword, cutting the Fryer
first in the head and face, who strugling with death, and purchasing his life with a
swift and nimble flight to a Garden, where his own brother a Fryer of the same Order,
&amp; Pander to that foul act, entertained the Motherlesse children; for the husband having
missed his fatall blow (willingly as some imagined, or unwillingly as others judged)
in the Fryers heart, wilfully laid it in the throat of his unchast Wife, scarce leaving way
for breath to make a speedy Confession of her sinne to <i>Navarro</i> his Brother; who tendring
her soule as much as his Brother had tendred her body absolved her from her
sinne, finding signes, though no uttering speech of Repentance, while the murderer
fled, and the murdered lay in the doore of her house for a sad object to all, that immediately
flocked thither to see that bloody Tragedy. The Wife being the same day buried,
the Husband being retired to a close Sanctuary, <i>Navarro</i> was carried to his Convent to
bee cured; and after his Cure was banished that Country; whom two yeares after
it was my chance to meet in <i>Cartagena</i> returning to <i>Spain</i> with his scard face, bearing
the marke of his lascivious life, and of that liberty which hee had injoyed in <i>America</i>.
Such are the fruits of the zeale of those wretches, who upbraid our Church and Ministers
for want of zeale to labour in the Conversion of Infidels. Who when they arrive
to those parts, are entertained with ringing of Bells, with sounding of Trumpets
most part of the way as they travaile, and as Apostles are received by the <i>Indians</i>, though
soon like <i>Judas</i> they fall from their calling, and for pleasure and covetousnesse sell away
Christ from their Soules. <i>England</i> may here learn to beware of such Converters,
who are daily by name of Missionaries sent hither by the Pope to preach among us Popery;
but like <i>Navarro</i> come to feed and cherish their wanton lusts, as I could give many
instances, might I not be censured for long digressions in mingling English Histories
with my <i>American</i> Travailes.</p>

<h4><i>Shewing to what Provinces of the East and West</i> India's <i>belonging to the Crown
of</i> Castilia <i>are sent Missions of Fryers and Jesuites. And specially of the
Mission sent in the yeare</i> 1625.</h4>


<p>In all the Dominions of the King of <i>Spain</i> in <i>America</i>, there are two sorts of Spaniards
more opposite one to another then in <i>Europe</i> the Spaniard is opposite to the French,
or to the Hollander, or to the Portingall; To wit, they that are born in any parts of
<i>Spain</i> and goe thither, and they that are borne there of Spanish parents, whom the
Spaniards, to distinguish them from themselves, terme <i>Criolio's</i>, signifying the Natives
of that Countrey. This hatred is so great, that I dare say, nothing might bee more
advantagious then this, to any other Nation that would conquer <i>America</i>. And nothing
more easily gained, then the Wils and affections of the Natives of the Country,
to joyne with any other Nation to free and rescue themselves from that subjection, or
kind of Slavery, which they suffer under the hard usage of the Spaniards, and their
partiall Government and justice toward them, and those that come from <i>Spain</i>. This
is so grievous to the poore Criolio's or Natives, that my selfe have often heard them
say, They would rather bee subject to any other Prince, nay to the <i>Hollanders</i>, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to the <i>Spaniards</i>, if they thought they might enjoy their Religion; and others wishing
the <i>Hollanders</i>, when they tooke <i>Truxillo</i> in <i>Honduras</i>, had stayed in it and entred
further into the land, they should have been welcome to them; and that the Religion
they enjoyed with so much slavery, was nothing sweet unto them. This mortall hatred
betwixt these two sorts of <i>Spaniards</i>, made the Criolio's so ready to joyn against
the Marquesse of <i>Gelves</i> Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>, in the tumult and mutiny of that City,
wherein they cleaving to <i>Don Alonso de Zerna</i>, the Arch-Bishop caused the Viceroy to
escape for his life by flight, and would then have utterly rooted out the Spanish Government,
had not some Preists disswaded them from it; but of this I shall speak more
largely hereafter. The cause of this deadly hatred hath proceeded from a jealousie
which the <i>Spaniards</i> have ever had of the Criolio's, that they would faine withdraw
themselves first from the commerce with <i>Spain</i>, and secondly, from the Government
which is laid upon them; which is such, that the Criolio's must be alwaies under,
and a subject, alwaies governed, but scarce any a Governour. Never yet was there
seen any Criolio made Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>, or <i>Peru</i>; or President of <i>Guatemala</i>, or
<i>Santa fe</i>, or S. <i>Domingo</i>; or Governour of <i>Yucatan, Cartagena, Havana</i>; or <i>Alcalde
Mayor</i> (as they call them) of <i>Soconusco, Chiapa, San Salvador</i>, and such like places
of credit. So likewise in the Courts of Chancery, as <i>Sto. Domingo, Mexico, Guatemala,
Lima</i>, and the rest, where commonly there are Six, called <i>Oydores</i> and one <i>Fiscal</i>,
scarce one of them to be found a Criolio, or native of the Countrey; though
there be among them those that descended of the chief Conquerors; as in <i>Lima</i> and <i>Peru</i>
the <i>Pizarros</i>, in <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Guaxaca</i> the house of the Marquesse <i>Del Valle, Ferdinando
Cortez</i> his Successors, others of the house of <i>Giron</i>, others of the house of <i>Alvarado</i>,
others of the <i>Guzmanes</i>, finally many of the chiefest houses of <i>Spain</i>; yet none
of these ever preferred to any dignity. And not onely thus are they kept from offices,
but daily affronted by the <i>Spaniards</i> as uncapable of any Government, and termed halfe
<i>Indians</i> by them.</p>

<p>Which generall contempt hath also spread it selfe in the Church, where no Criolio
Preist is scarce ever preferred to be a Bishop, or Canon in a Cathedrall Church, but all
such as come from <i>Spain</i>. So likewise in the religious orders they have many years indeavored
to keep under and suppress such as have bin admitted to their orders of the natives
of the Countrey, lest the number of them should prevail against those that are brought
from <i>Spain</i>; they have been very nice in choosing of them, &amp; though they have been forced
to admit of some, yet stil the Provincials, the Priors, and all Superiors have been <i>Spaniards</i>
born in <i>Spain</i>. Till now lately some Provinces have got the upper hand and prevailed
against the <i>Spaniards</i>, &amp; have so filled their cloisters with Criolio's or natives, that
they have utterly refused to admit the supplies of <i>Spanish</i> Missions which formerly were
sent unto them, and till this day are sent to others. In the Province of <i>Mexico</i> there are
Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustines, Carmelites, Mercenarians, and Jesuites, whereof
the Jesuites and Carmelites only to this day prevail against Criolio's, bringing every two
or three years Missions from <i>Spain</i>. The last Mission that was sent to the Mercenarians
was the year 1625. and then was the opposition such between that Mission and the
Criolio's, that in the election of the next Provinciall in their Cloister of <i>Mexico</i>, the
Fryers drew knives one against another, and were like to kill each other, had not the
Viceroy gone to their Cloister to make peace, and imprison some of them. Yet at
last by the multitude of voices the native party prevails, and till this day have exempted
themselves from <i>Spanish</i> Missions, alleadging (as others have done) that they
have Fryers enough in their Cloisters, and need none to be sent them from <i>Spain</i>; submitting
themselves to the Pope, and presenting to him as stately gifts as ever <i>Spaniards</i>
did before them. In the Province of <i>Guaxaca</i> none admit of Missionaries from <i>Spain</i>;
true it is the Dominicans are but newly subdued by the Criolian party; and as yet are
strongly pleading at <i>Rome</i> for <i>Spanish</i> Fryers, alleadging that the glory and lustre of
their Religion hath been much blurred since the non-admittance of supplies of
their zealous Compatriots. The Province of <i>Guatemala</i>, (which is of a large extent)
containing <i>Guatemala, Chiapa</i>, the <i>Zoques</i>, part of <i>Tabasco</i>, the <i>Zeldales</i>, the <i>Sacapulas</i>,
the <i>Vera Paz</i>, all the coast lying to the South sea <i>Suchutepeques</i> and <i>Soconusco, Comayagua,
Honduras, S. Salvador, Nicaragua</i> hath in it these orders chiefly, Dominicans,
Franciscans, Augustines, (who are subject to <i>Mexico</i> being one poore Cloister in <i>Guatemala</i>)
Jesuites also in <i>Guatemala</i> subject to the government of <i>Mexico</i> and Mercenarians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
whereof the three orders of Dominicans, Franciscans, and Mercenarians, are the
only Preachers and parish Preists throughout all the forenamed Provinces. And these
three Orders have still kept under the Criolian party, never as yet suffering any of them
to be Provinciall, bringing every two or three years some one year and some another,
Missions of Fryers from <i>Spain</i> to maintain and keep up their faction against the Criolians.
The Provinces of <i>Peru</i> being more distant from <i>Spain</i>, and hard to come to by sea,
have no Missions sent unto them. There are of the most Romish religious orders, yet the
chief are Dominicans; and they all live above their vow of poverty, abounding in wealth,
riot, liberty and pleasures. In the Kingdome of <i>Nuevo reino de Granada</i>, and <i>Cartagena,
Santa fee, Barinas, Popayan</i>, and the government of <i>St. Martha</i>, are Dominicans, Jesuites,
Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustines and Mercenarians, whereof the Dominicans, Jesuites
and Franciscans till this day admit of Missions from <i>Spain</i>. The Island of <i>Cuba, Jamaica,
la Margarita, Puerto rico</i>, all are subject to the head Provinciall of <i>Santo Domingo</i>,
being Dominicans, Jesuites, and Franciscans, and have all now and then Missions from
<i>Spain. Yucatan</i> hath in it only Franciscans, who live most richly and plentifully, and
strongly uphold the <i>Spanish</i> faction with <i>European</i> Missions: <i>Mechoacan</i> belongeth to the
<i>Mexican</i> Fryers, and is in the same condition as was said before of <i>Mexico.</i> Thus have
I briefly run over all <i>America</i> that pertains to the Crown of <i>Castilia</i>: for the <i>East-India's</i>
they belong to the Crown of <i>Portingall</i> and <i>Brasill</i>, as first discovered and possessed
by the <i>Portingalls</i>, and now doubtlesse are subject to King <i>John</i>, the new King of <i>Portingall</i>.
Yet the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i> are subject to the King of <i>Spain</i>, and there are Dominicans,
Franciscans, Augustines, and Jesuites, all which lie still in wait in <i>Manila</i> the
Metropolitan City, for some sure shipping to <i>Japan</i>, to convert that Kingdome. And
though they admit of some few Criolio's among them, especially some of their Converts
of <i>China</i> and <i>Japan</i>; yet their chief number and strength is of Spanish Missionaries,
who are more frequently conveyed thither then to the parts afore-mentioned
of <i>America</i>. First they are sent in the ships that are bound for <i>Nueva Espana</i> and <i>Mexico</i>;
and after they have rested two or three moneths in <i>Mexico</i>, they are sent to <i>Acapulco</i>,
lying on the <i>Mar del Zur</i>, there they are shipped in two great Caracks which yearly
go and come richly laden with <i>China, Japan</i>, and all <i>East-India</i> ware from <i>Manila</i> to
<i>Acapulco</i> to enrich <i>Mexico</i> with farre greater riches then any are sent by the North sea
from <i>Spain</i>. The voiage from <i>Acapulco</i> thither, is longer then from <i>Spain</i> to <i>Mexico</i>,
and easy and pleasant, though the return is farre longer and most dangerous. The
year of our Lord 1625. there were four Missions sent; the one of Franciscans to <i>Yucatan</i>,
the other of Mercenarians to <i>Mexico</i>, the other two of Dominicans and Jesuites
to <i>Philippinas</i>. At which time it was my fortune to reside among the Dominicans in
<i>Xerez</i> in <i>Andaluzia</i>. The Popes Commissary for that Mission was Fryer <i>Matheo de la
Villa</i>, who having a Commission for thirty and having gathered some 24 of them
about <i>Castilia</i> and <i>Madrid</i>, sent them by degrees well stored with mony to <i>Cales</i>, to take
up a convenient lodging for himselfe and the rest of his crew, till the time of the setting
forth of the <i>Indian</i> Fleet. This Commissary named one Fryer <i>Antonio Calvo</i> to be
his substitute, and to visit the Cloisters of <i>Andaluzia</i> lying in his way; namely <i>Cordova,
Sevill, St. Lucar</i>, and <i>Xerez</i>, to try if out of them he could make up his compleat
number of thirty, which was after fully compleated. About the end of <i>May</i> came
this worthy <i>Calvo</i> to <i>Xerez</i>, and in his Company one <i>Antonio Melendez</i> of the Colledge
of <i>St. Gregory</i> in <i>Valladolid</i>, with whom I had formerly neer acquaintance. This
<i>Melendez</i> greatly rejoyced when he had found mee; and being well stocked with <i>Indian</i>
Patacones, the first night of his coming invited me to his chamber to a stately supper.
The good <i>Xerez</i> Sack which was not spared, set my friend in such a heat of zeale of
converting <i>Japonians</i>, that all his talke was of those parts never yet seen, and at least
six thousand leagues distant. <i>Bacchus</i> metamorphosed him from a Divine into a
Orator, and made him a <i>Cicero</i> in parts of Rhetoricall eloquence. Nothing was omitted
that might exhort mee to joyne with him in that function, which he thought was
Apostolicall. <i>Nemo Propheta in patria sua</i>, was a great argument with him; sometimes
he propounded Martyrdome for the Gospel sake, and the glory after it, to have his
life and death printed, and of poore Fryer <i>Antony</i> a Clothiers son of <i>Segovia</i> to bee
stiled <i>St. Anthony</i> by the Pope, and made collaterall with the Apostles in heaven; thus
did <i>Bacchus</i> make him ambitious of honor upon the earth, and preferrement in heaven.
But when he thought this Rhetoricke had not prevailed, then would he act a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<i>Midas</i> and <i>Croesus</i>, fancying the <i>India's</i> paved with tiles of gold and silver, the stones
to be Pearls, Rubies, and Diamonds, the trees to bee hung with clusters of nutmegs
bigger then the clusters of grapes of <i>Canaan</i>, the fields to be planted with Sugar Canes,
which should so sweeten the <i>Chocolatte</i>, that it should farre exceed the milke and hony
of the land of promise; the silkes of <i>China</i> hee conceited so common, that the
sailes of the Ships were nothing else; finally he dreamed of <i>Midas</i> happinesse, that
whatsoever he touched should be turned to gold: Thus did <i>Xerez</i> Nectar make my friend
and mortified Fryer, a covetous worldling. And yet from a rich covetous Merchant
did it shape him to a Courtier in pleasures; fancying the <i>Philippinas</i> to be the <i>Eden</i>,
where was all joy without teares, mirth without sadnesse, laughing without sorrow,
comfort without griefe, plenty without want, no not of <i>Eves</i> for <i>Adams</i>, excepted only
that in it should be no forbidden fruit, but all lawfull for the taste and sweetning of the
palate; and as <i>Adam</i> would have been as God, so conceited <i>Melendez</i> himselfe a God
in that <i>Eden</i>, whom travelling, <i>Indian</i> Waites and trumpets should accompany; and
to whom, entring into any Town, nosegaies should be presented, flowers and boughes
should be strowed in his way, Arches should be erected to ride under, Bels for joy should
be rung, and <i>Indian</i> knees for duty &amp; homage, as to a God, should be bowed to the very
ground. From this inducing argument, and representation of a Paradise, he fell into
a strong Rhetoricall point of curiosity; finding out a tree of knowledge, and a Philosophicall
maxime, <i>Omnus homo naturaliter scire desiderat</i>, man naturally inclines to know
more and more; which knowledge he fancied could be no where more furnished with
rare curiosities then in those parts; for there should the Gold and Silver, which here
are fingered, in their growth in the bowels of the earth be known; there should the
pepper be known in its season, the nutmeg and Clove, the Cinnamon as a rine or bark
on a tree; the fashioning of the Sugar from a green growing Cane into a loaf; the
strange shaping the <i>Cochinil</i> from a worme to so rich a Scarlet die; the changing of the
<i>Tinta</i> which is but grasse with stalke and leaves into an <i>Indigo</i> black dye, should be taught
and learned; and without much labour thus should our ignorance be instructed with
various and sundry curiosities of knowledge and understanding. Finally, though <i>Xerez</i>
liquor (grapes bewitching tears) had put this bewitching eloquence into my <i>Antonies</i>
brain, yet he doubted not to preferre before it his wine of <i>Philippinas</i>, growing
on tall and high trees of <i>Coco</i>, wherein he longed to drinke a Spanish Brindis in my
company to all his friends remaining behind in <i>Spain</i>. Who would not bee moved by
these his arguments to follow him, and his <i>Calvo</i>, or ball pated Superiour? Thus supper
being ended my <i>Melendez</i> desired to know how my heart stood affected to his journey;
and breaking out into a <i>Voto a Dios</i> with his converting zeal, he swore he should
have no quiet nights rest untill he were fully satisfied of my resolution to accompany
him. And having learned the Poets expression, <i>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra
fames?</i> he offered unto me halfe a dozen of Spanish pistols, assuring me that I should
want nothing, and that the next morning <i>Calvo</i> should furnish me with whatsoever monies
I needed, for to buy things necessary for the comfort of so long and tedious a journy.
To whom I answered, suddain resolutions might bring future grief and sorrow, and
that I should that night lye down and take counsell with my pillow, assuring him that
for his sake I would doe much, and that if I resolved to goe, my resolution should draw
on an other friend of mine, an Irish Fryer, named <i>Thomas Deloon</i>. Thus tooke I my
leave of my <i>Melendez</i>, and retired my self to my chamber and bed, which that night
was no place of repose and rest to me as formerly it had been. I must needs say <i>Melendez</i>
his arguments, though most of them moved me not; yet the opportunity offered me
to hide my self from all sight and knowledge of my dearest friends, stirred up in me a
serious thought of an angry and harsh letter, which not long before I had received out
of <i>England</i> from mine own father, signifying unto me the displeasure of most of my
friends and kindred, and his own grievous indignation against me, for that having
spent so much money in training me up to learning, I had not only utterly refused to
be of the Jesuites Order (which was his only hopes) but had proved in my affections
a deadly foe and enemy unto them. And that he would have thought his money better
spent, if I had been a Scullion in a Colledge of Jesuites, then if I should
prove a Generall of the Order of Dominicans; that I should never think to
be welcome to my Brothers nor kindred in <i>England</i>, nor to him; that I should not expect
ever more to heare from him, nor dare to see him if ever I returned to <i>England</i>; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
expect that he would set upon mee even Jesuites, whom I had deserted and opposed,
to chace mee out of my Country; that <i>Hailing</i> house though hee had lost it with much
more meanes for his Religion during his life; yet with the consent of my Eldest Brother
(now Governour of <i>Oxford</i>, and Masse-founder in that our Famous University)
hee would sell it away; that neither from the Estate, or money made of it, I might
injoy a childs part due unto mee. These reasons stole that nights rest from my body,
and sleep from my eyes, teares keeping them unclosed and open, lest <i>Cynthia's</i> black and
mourning Mantle should offer to cover, close and shut them. To this Letters consideration
was joyned a strong opposition, which serious Studies &amp; ripenesse of Learning, with
a carefull discussion of some Schoole-points and Controversies had bred in mee against
some chief of the Popish Tenents. Well could I have wished to have come to <i>England</i>,
there to satisfie and ease my troubled Conscience; well considered I, that if I stayed in
<i>Spain</i>, when my Studies were compleatly finished, the Dominicans with a Popes Mandamus
would send me home for a Missionary to my Country. But then well considered I the
sight of a wrathfull Father, the power of a furious Brother a Colonell, who (as now
landed in <i>England</i> to search me out, and do me mischief) then, when <i>Zephryus</i> with a pleasant
gale seconded his Popish zeale, might violently assault mee. Well considered I the
increased rout and rable of both their great friends, the Jesuites, who what with Court
friends power, what with subtile plots and Policies would soone and easily hunt me out
of <i>England</i>. Lastly, well considered I my <i>Melendez</i> his last inducing Argument of
the increase of knowledge naturall by the insight of rich <i>America</i> and flourishing <i>Asia</i>,
and of knowledge spirituall by a long contemplation of that new planted Church, and
of those Church Planters lives and Conversations. Wherefore after a whole nights
strife and inward debate, as the glorious Planet began to banish nights dismall horror,
rising with a bright and cheerefull countenance, rose in my minde a firme and setled resolution
to visit <i>America</i>, and there to abide till such time as Death should surprise my
angry Father, <i>Ignatius Loiola</i> his devoted Mecænas, and till I might there gain out of
<i>Potosi</i> or <i>Sacatecas</i> treasure that might Counterpoise that Childs part, which for detesting
the foure Cornered Cap, and black Coat of Jesuites, my Father had deprived
mee of. So in recompence of the Supper which my friend <i>Anthony</i> had bestowed upon
mee, I gave him a most pleasing breakfast by discovering unto him my purpose and
resolution to accompany him in his long and Navall journey. And at noon I feasted him
with a dinner of one dish more then his breakfast, to wit, the company also of my
Irish friend <i>Thomas Deloon</i>. After dinner wee both were presented to <i>Calvo</i> the bald pate
Superiour; who immediately imbraced us, promised to us many curtesies in the way,
read unto us a Memorandum of what dainties he had provided for us, what varieties of
fish and flesh, how many Sheep, how many Gammons of Bacon, how many fat Hens,
how many Hogs, how many barrels of white Bisket, how many Jars of wine of <i>Casalla</i>,
what store of Rice, Figs, Olives, Capars, Raysins, Lemmons, sweet and sowre
Oranges, Pomegranates, Comfits, Preserves, Conserves and all sorts of <i>Portingall</i> sweet
meates; hee flattered us that hee would make us Masters of Arts, and of Divinity in <i>Manila</i>;
then opened hee his purse, and freely gave us to spend that day in <i>Xerez</i>, and to
buy what most we had a mind to, and to carry us to <i>Cales</i>; Lastly hee opened his
hands to bestow upon us the holy Fathers Benediction, that no mischiefe might befall
us in our way; I expected some Relique or naile of his great toe, or one of his velvet
Pantofles to kisse; But peradventure with frequent kissing through <i>Italy</i> and all <i>Castilia</i> it
was even worn thredbare. Much were wee frowned at by the Dominicans our chiefest friends
of <i>Xerez</i>, but the liberty which with <i>Melendez</i> we injoyed that day about the City
of <i>Xerez</i> tooke from us all sad thoughts, which so suddaine a departure from our friends
might have caused in us. And <i>Calvo</i> much fearing that the love of some Nuns (too
powerfull with Spanish Fryers) might yet keep us back from pursuing our purposed
journey, with cunning policy perswaded us to depart from <i>Xerez</i> the next morning.
Which willingly wee performed in company of <i>Melendez</i> and another Spanish Fryer
of that City (leaving our Chests and Bookes to <i>Calvo</i> to send after us) and that day
wee travailed like Spanish Dons upon our little Boricoes, or Asses towards <i>Puerto de
Santa Maria</i>, taking in our way that stately Convent of <i>Cartusians</i>, and the River of
<i>Guadalethe</i>, the former Poets River of oblivion, tasting of the fruits of those <i>Elysian</i>
fields and Gardens and drinking of <i>Guadalethes</i> Crystall Streams, that so perpetuall oblivion
might blind and cover all those Abstractive Species which the intuitive knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of <i>Spains</i> and <i>Xerezes</i> pleasant objects had deeply stamped in our thoughts and
hearts. At evening wee came to that <i>Puerto</i> so famous for harbouring <i>Spains</i> chief Gallies,
and at that time <i>Don Frederique de Toledo</i>; who hearing of the arrivall of foure <i>Indian</i>
Apostles, would not loose that occasion of some Soule-Sanctification (which he thought
might bee his purchase) by entertaining us that night at Supper. The Town thought
their Streets blessed with our walking in them, and wished they might injoy some Reliques
from us, whom they beheld as appointed to Martyrdome for Christ and Antichrists
sake together; the Galley slaves strived who should sound their Waits and Trumpets
most joyfully, <i>Don Frederique</i> spared no cost in Fish and Flesh that night, doubting
not but that receiving foure Prophets, hee should receive a fourefold reward hereafter.
Supper being ended, wee were by <i>Don Frederique</i> his Gentlemen conveyed to the Cloister
of the <i>Minims</i> appointed by <i>Don Frederique</i> to lodge us that night, who to shew
their brotherly love washed our feet, and so recommended us to quiet and peaceable
rest. The next morning after a stately breakfast bestowed upon us by those poor Mendicant
Fryers, a boat was prepared for us and <i>Don Frederique</i> his Gentlemen to wait on
us, and to convey us to <i>Cales</i>. Where wee found out our fellow Apostles, and the
Popes Commissary Fryer <i>Mathew De la Villa</i>, who welcomed us with <i>Romes</i> Indulgences,
<i>a culpa &amp; a poena</i>, and with a flourishing Table stored with Fish and Flesh for
dinner. There wee continued in daily honour and estimation, enjoying the sights
most pleasant which <i>Cales</i> both by Sea and Land could afford unto us, untill the time
of the Fleets departing. Which when it drew neere, our Grand Apostle Fryer <i>Mathew
De la Villa</i>, (whom wee thought burned with zeal of Martyrdome) tooke his leave of
us; shewing us the Popes Commission to nominate in his place whom hee list, and naming
bald <i>Calvo</i> for Superiour, returning himselfe to <i>Madrid</i> with more desire to
enjoy a Bishoprick in <i>Spain</i> (as wee understood) then to sacrifice his life in <i>Japan</i>. His
departure caused a Mutiny among us, and cooled the spirit of two of our Missionaries,
who privily fled from us. The rest were pleased with honest <i>Calvo</i>, for that hee was a
simple and ignorant old man, (whom they could more jeere then any way respect)
more Scullion-like in daily greazing his white habit with handling his fat Gammons
of Bacon, then like a Popes Commissary; for his Masters Toe the proudest of our
Missioners then would willingly have kissed; yet <i>Calvoes</i> greazy fists the humblest
would loath to have kissed. Thus under a sloven was that Apostolicall Mission to bee
conveyed first to <i>Mexico</i> three thousand <i>Spanish</i> Leagues from <i>Spain</i>, and afterwards
three thousand Leagues further from thence to <i>Manila</i> the Metropolitan and Court City
of the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Of the</i> Indian <i>Fleet that departed from</i> Cales, Anno Dom. 1625. <i>And of some
remarkable passages in that Voiage.</i></h4>


<p>Upon the first of <i>July</i> in the afternoon, <i>Don Carlos de Ybarra</i> Admirall of the Galeons
that then lay in the Baye of <i>Cales</i> gave order that a warning Peece should be shot off
to warne all Passengers, Souldiers, and Mariners to betake themselves the next morning
to their Ships. O what was it to see some of our Apostolicall company who had injoyed
much liberty for a moneth in <i>Cales</i>, who had began to entangle their hearts with some
young Nuns love, now hang down their heads, and act with sad and demure lookes
loath to depart, and cry out, <i>Bonum est nos hic esse</i>, it is good for us to be here? and amongst
them one Fryer <i>John De Pacheco</i> made the warning Peece to be a warning to him to hide
himself (who could no more be found amongst his fellow Missioners) thinking it a part
of hard cruelty to forsake a young Franciscan Nun to whom he had engaged and wholly
devoted his heart. What was it to see others with weeping eyes piercing through the
Iron grates the tender Virgins hearts, leaving and bequeathing unto them some pledges
of their wanton love, and receiving from them some Cordialls against Sea-sicknesse,
Caps, Shirts and Hand-kerchiefs, to eye them or weare them when <i>Æolus</i> or <i>Neptune</i>
should most oppose them? The second of <i>July</i> in the morning early notice was given
unto us, that one Fryer <i>Pablo de Londres</i>, an old crab faced English Fryer living in
St. <i>Lucar</i> had got the Duke of <i>Medina</i> his letter and sent it to the Governour of <i>Cales</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
charging him to search for me &amp; to stay me, signifying the King of <i>Spains</i> will and pleasure,
that no <i>English</i> should passe to the <i>India's</i>, having a Countrey of their own to convert;
this did that old fryer to stop my passage, having before wrote unto me many letters
to the same purpose, and got a letter from that father <i>Master</i> that was in <i>England</i> before,
with the Count of <i>Gondomar, alias</i> Fryer <i>Diego de la Fluente</i>, then Provinciall of
<i>Castilia</i>, and sent it unto mee, wherein that Superiour offered mee many kind offers
of preferrement, if I would desist from my journey, and return to him to <i>Castilia</i>;
but none of these letters could prevail with mee; nor the Governours searching
stop mee; for immediately I was conveyed alone to our ship, and there closely hid in
a barrell that was emptied of Bisquet to that purpose; so that when the Governour
came a ship-board to enquire for an <i>English</i> man, Fryer <i>Calvo</i> having the father of liers
in my stead about him, resolutely denyed mee, who would not be found, because
not sought for in a barrells belly. This found our Apostles sport and talk that first day.
Then went out the ships one by one crying <i>A dios, A dios</i>, and the Towne replying
<i>Buen viaie, buen viaie</i>; when all were out and no hopes of enjoying more <i>Cales</i> pleasures
and liberty, then began my young Fryers to wish themselves again a Land, some
began presently to feed the fishes with their Nuns sweet dainties; others to wonder at
the number of stately ships, which with eight Galeons that went to convey us beyond
the Islands of <i>Canaria</i> were fourty one in all; some for one Port of the <i>Indiaes</i>, and
some for another. To <i>Puerto Rico</i> went that year two ships; to <i>Santo Domingo</i> three,
to <i>Jamaica</i> two, to <i>Margarita</i> one, to the <i>Havana</i> two, to <i>Cartagena</i> three, to
<i>Campeche</i> two, to <i>Honduras</i> and <i>Truxillo</i> two, and to <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, or <i>Vera Crux</i> sixteen;
all laden with Wines, Figs, Raisins, Olives, Oyle, Cloth, Carsies, Linnen,
Iron, and quick silver for the Mines, to fetch out the pure silver of <i>Sacatecas</i> from the
earthen drosse from whence it is digged. The persons of most note that went that year,
was first the Marquesse <i>de Serralvo</i> with his Lady, who went for Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>,
in stead of the Conde <i>de Gelves</i> then retired to a Cloister for feare of the common
people, who the year before had mutinied against him; this Marquesse went in the ship
called <i>St. Andrew</i>, and with him in the same ship went <i>Don Martin de Carillo</i> a Preist,
and Inquisitor of the Inquisition of <i>Valladolid</i>; who was sent for Visiter Generall to <i>Mexico</i>,
to examine the strife between the Conde <i>de Gelves</i> and the Arch-Bishop, and the
mutiny that for their sakes had happened, with full Commission and Authority to imprison,
banish, hang and execute all Delinquents. In the ship called <i>Santa Gertrudis</i>
went <i>Don John Nino de Toledo</i>, who was sent to be President of <i>Manila</i> in <i>Philippinas</i>;
and in the same ship with him went the whole Mission of thirty Jesuites sent to <i>Philippinas</i>;
who had already got the favour of the President, and politickly sought to
be passengers in the same ship, that so they might the more ingratiate themselves to
him; for this cunning generation studies purposely how to insinuate themselves with
Kings, Princes, Great men, Rulers, and Commanders. In the ship called <i>St. Antony</i> went
my Dominican Mission of 27 Fryers. In the ship called <i>Nostra Sennora de Regla</i> went four
and twenty Mercenarian Fryers bound for <i>Mexico</i>; part of those that afterwards drew
their knives to slash and cut the Criolio's of their Profession. Thus with the Convoy of
eight Galeons for fear of <i>Turkes</i> and <i>Hollanders</i> (whom the Spanish <i>Dons</i> shake and tremble
at) set forward our fleet with a pleasant and prosperous gale, with a quiet and milken
sea, untill we came to the Golfe, called <i>Golfo de Yeguas</i>, or of <i>kicking Mares</i>, whose waves
and swelling surges did so kick our ships, that wee thought they would have kicked
our <i>St. Anthonies</i> gilded image out of our ship, and bereaved my <i>Antonio Melendez</i> of
his gilt and painted idol, (to whom hee daily bowed and prayed against the mercilesse
element,) and that all our ships galleries would have been torn from us with these
spurnings and blowes of that outragious Golfe. But at last having overcome the
danger of this Golfe, the eight Galeons took their leave of us, and left our Merchant
ships now to shift for themselves. The departure of these Galeons was most solemnly
performed on each side, saluting each other with their Ordnance, visiting each other
with their Cock-boates, the Admirall of the Fleet feasting with a stately dinner in his
ship, the Admirall of the Galeons; and the like performing most of the other ships to
the severall Colonells and Captains and other their allied friends that were of the Roiall
Fleet. Here it was worth noting to heare the sighes of many of our <i>Indian</i> Apostles,
wishing they might return again in any of those Galeons to <i>Spain</i>; their zeal was
now cold, and some endeavoured many waies for <i>Calvo</i> his licence to returne (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
could not be granted) others imployed themselves most of that day in writing letters
to their friends, and Sisters in <i>Cales</i>. Thus dinner being ended, and the two Admiralls
solemnly taking their leaves, the warning piece being shot off for the Galeons to
joyn together, and turne their course to <i>Spain</i>, we bad mutuall adieu, crying one to
another <i>Buen Viaie, Buen passage</i>; we kept our course towards <i>America</i>, sailing before
the wind constantly till we came to <i>America</i>; a thing worth noting in that voiage from
<i>Spain</i> to the <i>Indies</i>; that after the Islands of <i>Canaria</i> are once left, there is one constant
wind, continuing to <i>America</i> still the same without any opposition or contrariety of
other winds; and this so prosperous and full on the sailes, that did it blow constantly,
and were it not interrupted with many calmes, doubtlesse the voiage might be ended in
a moneth or lesse. But such were the calmes that many times we had, that we got not
to the sight of any land till the twentieth day of <i>August</i>; so that neer six weeks we sailed
as on a river of fresh water, much delighting and sporting our selves in fishing many sorts
fishes, but especially one, which by the <i>Spaniards</i> is called <i>Dorado</i>, the golden fish,
for the skin and scales of it that glitter like gold; of this sort we found such abundance,
that no sooner was the hooke with any small bait cast into the sea, when presently the
<i>Dorado</i> was caught, so that we tooke them many times for pleasure, and cast them againe
into the sea, being a fish fitter to be eaten fresh then salted. Many were the feasts
and sports used in the ships, till wee discovered the first land, or Island called <i>Desseada</i>.
The last day of <i>July</i> (being according to the Jesuites Order, and <i>Romes</i> appointment,
the day of <i>Ignatius</i> their Patron and founder of their Religion) the gallant ship called
<i>Sta. Gertrudis</i> (wherein went 30 Jesuites) for theirs and their Saints sake made to
all the rest of the Fleet a most gallant shew, shee being trimmed round about with
white linnen, her flags and top gallants representing some the Jesuites arms, others the
picture of <i>Ignatius</i> himself, and this from the evening before, shooting off that night at
least fifty Shot of Ordinance, besides four or five hundred squibs (the weather being very
calme) and all her masts and tacklings hung with paper Lanthornes having burning
lights within them; the waits ceased not from sounding, nor the <i>Spaniards</i> from singing
all night. The daies solemne sport was likewise great, the Jesuites increasing the <i>Spaniards</i>
joy with an open procession in the ship, singing their superstitious Hymnes and
Anthemes to their supposed Saint, and all this seconded with roaring Ordnance, no
powder being spared for the compleating of that daies joy and triumph. The fourth
of <i>August</i> following, being the day which <i>Rome</i> doth dedicate to <i>Dominick</i>, the first
founder of the Dominicans or Preachers Order, the ship wherein I was, named
<i>St. Anthony</i>, strived to exceed <i>Sta. Gertrudis</i>, by the assistance of the 27 Dominicans that
were in her. All was performed both by night and day; as formerly in <i>Sta. Gertrudis</i>,
both with powder, squibs, lights, Waits and musick. And further did the Dominicans
joy and triumph exced the Jesuites, in that they invited all the Jesuites, with <i>Don
John Nino de Toledo</i> the President of <i>Manila</i>, with the Captaine of the ship of <i>Sta. Gertrudis</i>,
to a stately dinner both of Fish and Flesh; which dinner being ended, for the
afternoones sport they had prepared a Comedy out of famous <i>Lope de Vega</i>, to be acted
by some Souldiers, Passengers and some of the younger sort of Fryers; which I confesse
was as stately acted and set forth both in shewes and good apparell, in that narrow
compasse of our ship, as might have been upon the best stage in the Court of <i>Madrid</i>.
The Comedy being ended, and a banquet of sweet meates prepared for the closing up of
that daies mirth, both ours, and <i>Sta. Gertrudis</i> Cock-boat carried backe our invited
friends, bidding each other adieu with our Waits and chiefest Ordnance. Thus went
we on our Sea Voiage without any storme, with pleasant gales, many calmes, dayly
sports and pastimes till we discovered the first land called <i>Desseada</i> upon the twentieth
day of <i>August</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_VI" id="CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Of our discovery of some Islands, and what trouble befell us in one of them.</i></h4>


<p>The Admirall of our Fleet wondring much at our slow sailing, who from the second
of <i>July</i> to the 19 of <i>August</i> had seen nor discovered any land, save only the Islands
of <i>Canaria</i>; the same day in the morning called to Councell all the Pilots of the ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to know their Opinions concerning our present being, and the neernesse of Land. The
Ships therefore drew neere unto the Admirall one by one, that every Pilot might deliver
his opinion. Here was cause of laughter enough, for the passengers to heare the
wise Pilots skil; One saying, we were three hundred miles, another two hundred, another
one hundred, another fifty, another more, another lesse, all erring much from
the truth (as afterward appeared) save onely one old Pilot of the smallest Vessell of
all, who affirmed resolutely, that with that small gale wherewith wee then sailed, wee
should come to <i>Guadalupe</i> the next morning. All the rest laughed at him, but he might
well have laughed at them, for the next morning by Sun-rising wee plainly discovered
an Island called <i>Desseada</i> by the <i>Spaniards</i>, or the desired Land, for that at the first
discovery of the <i>India's</i> it was the first Land the <i>Spaniards</i> found, being then as desirous
to find some Land after many dayes sailing as wee were. After this Island presently we
discovered another called <i>Marigalante</i>, then another called <i>Dominica</i>, and lastly, another
named <i>Guadalupe</i>, which was that wee aimed at to refresh our selves in, to wash
our foule cloathes, and to take in fresh water, whereof wee stood in great need. By
two or three of the clock in the afternoone wee came to a safe Rode lying before the
Island, where wee cast our Anchors, no wayes fearfull of the naked Barbarians of that
and the other Islands, who with great joy doe yearly expect the <i>Spanish</i> Fleets coming,
and by the Moones doe reckon the Moneths, and thereby make their guesse
at their comming, and prepare some their sugar Canes, others the Plantin, others the Tortois,
some one Provision, some another to barter with the <i>Spaniards</i> for their small
Haberdash, or Iron, Knives, or such things which may help them in their Wars, which
commonly they make against some other Islands. Before our Anchors were cast, out
came the <i>Indians</i> to meet us in their Canoa's, round like Troughes, some whereof had
beene painted by our <i>English</i>, some by the <i>Hollanders</i>, some by the <i>French</i>, as might appeare
by their severall Armes, it being a common Rode and harbour to all Nations that saile
to <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>Before wee resolved to goe to shore, wee tasted of those <i>Indian</i> fruites, the plantin
above all pleasing our taste and Palate. Wee could not but much wonder at that
sight never yet seene by us of people naked, with their haire hanging down to the middle
of their backes, with their faces cut out in severall fashions, or flowers, with thin
plates hanging at their Noses, like Hog-rings, and fauning upon us like children,
some speaking in their unknowne tongue, others using signs for such things as we imagined
they desired. Their signe for some of our <i>Spanish</i> Wine was easily perceived,
and their request most willingly granted to by our men, who with one reasonable Cup
of <i>Spanish</i> Sacke presently tumbled up their heeles, and left them like swine tumbling on
the Deck of our Ship. After a while that our people had sported with these rude and
Savage Indians, our two Cock-Boates were ready to carry to shore such as either had
clothes to wash, or a desire to bathe themselves in a River of fresh Water which is
within the Island, or a mind to set their feet again upon unmoveable Land, after so
many daies of uncertain footing in a floating and reeling Ship. But that day being
farre spent, our Fryers resolved to stay in the Ship, and the next whole day to visit
the Island; many of the Mariners and Passengers of all the Ships went that evening to
shore, some returning at night, and some without feare continuing with the <i>Indians</i>
all night on shore. The next morning my selfe and most of our Fryers went and
having hired some <i>Spaniards</i> to wash our cloathes, we wandred sometimes all together
sometimes two and two, and sometimes one alone about the Island, meeting with many
<i>Indians</i>, who did us no hurt, but rather like children fauned upon us, offering us of their
fruits, and begging of us whatsoever toies of pins, points or gloves they espied about us.
Wee ventured to goe to some of their houses which stood by a pleasant River, and
were by them kindly entertained, eating of their fish, and wild deeres flesh. About
noone wee chanced to meet with some of the Jesuites of <i>Santa Gertrudis</i> Ship in the
midst of the Mountain, who were very earnest in talke with a <i>Mulatto</i>, all naked like
the rest of the <i>Indians</i>. This <i>Mulatto</i> was a Christian, born in <i>Sevill</i> in <i>Spain</i>, and had
been slave there formerly to a rich Merchant, his name was Lewis, and spoke the <i>Spanish</i>
Language very perfectly. Some twelve yeeres before, hee had run away from his Master
by reason of hard and slavish usage, and having got to <i>Cales</i>, offering his service to a
Gentleman then bound for <i>America</i>, the Gentleman fearing not that his true Master
should ever have more notice of him from a new World, took him a Ship board with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
him as his slave. The <i>Mulatto</i> remembring the many stripes which hee had suffered
from his first cruell Master, and fearing that from <i>America</i> hee might by some intelligence
or other be sent back again to <i>Spain</i>, and also jealous of his Second Master (whose
blowes hee had begun to suffer in the Ship) that hee would prove as cruell as his first;
when the Ships arrived at <i>Guadalupe</i>, resolved rather to die among the <i>Indians</i> (which
hee knew might be his hardest fortune) then evermore to live in slavery under <i>Spaniards</i>.
So casting his life upon good or bad fortune, hee hid himselfe among the trees in the
Mountaine till the Ships were departed; who after being found by the <i>Indians</i>, and giving
them some toyes which hee had got by stealth from his Master, hee was entertained
by them, they liking him, and hee them. Thus continued this poore Christian slave
among those Barbarians from yeare to yeare; who had care to hide himselfe at the
comming of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet yearely. In twelve yeares that hee had thus continued
amongst them, hee had learned their language, was married to an <i>Indian</i>, by whom
hee had three children living. The Jesuites by chance having met with him, and perceiving
more by the Wooll upon his head, that hee was a <i>Mulatto</i>, then by his black
and tauny skin (for those <i>Indians</i> paint themselves all over with a red colour) they
presently imagined the truth that hee could not come thither but with some <i>Spaniard</i>,
so entering into discourse with him, and finding him to speak <i>Spanish</i>, they got the
whole truth of him. Then wee joyning with the Jesuites, began to perswade the poore
Christian to forsake that heathenish life, wherein his soule could never bee saved, promising
him if hee would goe along with us, hee should bee free from slavery forever.
Poore Soule, though hee had lived twelve yeares without hearing a word of the true
God, worshipping stockes and stones with the other Heathens; yet when hee heard again
of Christ, of eternall damnation in hells torments, and of everlasting Salvation
in Heavens joyes, hee began to weep, assuring us that hee would goe with us, were
it not for his Wife and Children, whom hee tenderly loved, and could not forsake
them. To this wee replyed, that thee might be a meanes of saving likewise their Souls,
if hee would bring them with him; and further that wee would assure him that care
should bee taken that neither hee, his Wife, nor children should ever want meanes competent
for the maintenance of their lives. The <i>Mulatto</i> hearkned well to all this, though
a suddaine feare surprized him, because certaine <i>Indians</i> passed by, and noted his
long conference with us. The poore and timorous <i>Mulatto</i> then told us, that hee was
in danger, for having been knowen by us, and that hee feared the <i>Indians</i> would kill
him, and suspect that wee would steale him away; which if they did, and it were
noised about the island, wee should soone see their love changed into cruell rage and
Mutiny. Wee perswaded him not to feare any thing they could doe to us, who had
Souldiers, Guns and Ordnance to secure ours and his life also, wishing him to resolve
to bring his Wife and Children but to the Sea side, where our men were drying their
Clothes, and would defend him, and a Boat should bee ready to convey him with his
Wife and Children a Ship board. The <i>Mulatto</i> promised to doe as wee had counselled
him, and that hee would entice his Wife and Children to the Sea side to barter with
us their Wares for ours, desiring some of the Jesuites (whom hee said he should know
by their black Coates) to bee there ready for him with a Cock-Boat. <i>Lewis</i> departed,
as to us hee seemed resolute in what hee had agreed; Our joy likewise was great with
the hope of bringing to the light of Christianity five Soules out of the darknesse of
heathenish Idolatry. The Jesuites who had begun with this <i>Mulatto</i> were desirous that
the happy end and conclusion might bee their glory. So taking their leaves of us, they
hastened to the Sea to informe the Admirall of what they had done, and to provide
that the Cock-Boat of their Ship might bee in readinesse to receive <i>Lewis</i>, and his family.
Wee likewise returned to the shore to see if our Shirts, and Clothes were dry.
Most of us (among whom my selfe was one) finding our Linnen ready and our Boat
on Shore went aboard to our Ship, leaving two or three of our company with many of
other Ships on shore, especially the Jesuites waiting for their prey. When we came to
our Ship, most of our Fryers with what love they had found in the Barbarians, were
inflamed with a new zeale of staying in that Island, and converting those Heathens to
Christianity, apprehending it an easie businesse (they being a loving people) and no
wayes dangerous to us, by reason of the Fleet that yearely passeth that way, and
might enquire after our usage. But by some it was objected, that it was a rash and foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
zeale with great hazard of their lives, and many inconveniences were objected against
so blind and simple an attempt. But those that were most zealous slighted all reasons,
saying that the worst that could happen to them could bee but to be butchered, sacrificed
and eaten up; and that for such a purpose they had come out of <i>Spain</i> to be crowned
with the Crowne of Martyrdome for confessing and preaching Jesus Christ. While
wee were hot in this solemne consultation, behold an uproare on the shoare; our people
running to and fro to save their lives, leaving their clothes, and hasting to the Cock-Boats,
filling them so fast and so full, that some sunke with all the people in them; Above
al, most pitiful and lamentable were the cries of some of our women, many casting themselves
to the Sea, choosing rather to venture to be taken up by some Boat, or at worst
to bee drowned, then to bee taken and to bee cruelly butchered by the <i>Indians</i>. Wee
wondering at this suddain alteration, not knowing the cause of it, at last perceived the
Arrowes to come out thick from the Wood from behind the Trees, and thereby guessed
at the truth that the Barbarians were mutinied. The uproare lasted not halfe an houre,
for presently our Admirall shot off two or three Peeces of Ordnance and sent a Company
of Souldiers to shore to guard it and our people with their Muskets; which was
well and suddainly performed, and all the <i>Indians</i> soon dispersed. Three of our Fryers
who had remained on the land, our Cock-Boat brought them to us with more of
our Passengers, among whom one Fryer <i>John de la Cueva</i>, was dangerously shot and
wounded in one of his shoulders; this Fryer had beene earnest with mee to stay on
shore with him, which I refused, and so escaped that cruell and fiery onset of the <i>Indians</i>.
Besides those that were drowned and taken up at shore (which were fifteen persons)
two Jesuites were found dead upon the Sand, three more dangerously wounded,
three passengers likewise slaine, ten wounded, besides three more of the Fleet which
could never bee found alive or dead, and were thought to have beene found in the
Wood by the <i>Indians</i>, and to have beene murthered by them. Our <i>Mulatto Lewis</i>
came not according to his word; but in his stead a suddaine Army of treacherous <i>Indians</i>,
which gave us motive enough to thinke, that either <i>Lewis</i> himselfe had discovered
the Jesuites Plot to take him away with his Wife and Children; or that the <i>Indians</i>
suspecting it by his talke with us had made him confesse it. And certainly this was
the ground of their Mutiny; for whereas <i>Lewis</i> before had said, that hee would know
the Jesuites by their black Coats, it seemes hee had well described them above all the
rest unto the <i>Indians</i>, for (as it was after well observed) most of their Arrowes was directed
to the black Markes, and so five of them in little above a quarter of an houre
slaine and wounded. All that night our Souldiers guarded the Coast, often shooting
off their Muskets, to affright the <i>Indians</i>, who appeared no more unto us. All that
night wee slept little, for wee watched our Ship; lest the <i>Indians</i> in their Canoas
should set upon us and take us asleepe. Some lamented the dead and drowned, others
pitied our wounded Fryer <i>John De la Cueva</i>, who all that night lay in great torment and
misery, others laughed and jeared at those zealous Fryers, who would have stayed in
that Island to Convert the Barbarians, saying they had had their full desire of Martyrdome,
for had they beene but that night with the <i>Indians</i>, doubtlesse they had beene
shred for their Suppers. But now wee perceived their zeale was coole, and they desired
no more to stay with such a Barbarous kind of People; but rather wished the Admirall
would shoot off the warning Peece for us all to take up our Anchors, and depart
from so dangerous a place. In the morning all the Ships made hast to take in such fresh
water as was necessary for their voiage yet to <i>America</i>, a strong watch being kept along
the Coast, and a Guard guarding our men to the River; and all the morning while
this was doing not one <i>Indian</i> could bee found or seen, nor our three men that were missing,
appeared. Thus at noone with a pleasant and prosperous Gale we hoisted up our
Sailes, leaving the Islands, and harbour of <i>Guadalupe</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Of our further Sayling to St.</i> John de Ulhua, aliàs, Vera Crux; <i>and of our
landing there.</i></h4>


<p>Upon the 22 day of <i>August</i>, wee sailed so pleasantly that wee soone left the sight of
the Islands; The <i>Indians</i> uproare had weaved for us a thred of long discourse; It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
made some hate their calling to teach and convert <i>Indians</i>, but <i>Calvo</i> hee encouraged
us, telling us many Stories of the good and gentle nature of the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Philippinas</i>,
to whom we were going, and that most of them were Christians already, who esteemed
their Preists as Gods upon the earth; and that those that were not as yet converted
to Christianity, were kept in awe by the power of the <i>Spaniards</i>. Our chiefe care the
first two or three daies was to looke to our plantins which we got from the <i>Indians</i>.
This fruit pleased us all exceedingly, judging it to bee as good, or better then any fruit
in <i>Spain</i>. It is not gathered ripe from the tree; but being gathered green, it is hung
up some daies, and so ripens and growes yellow and mellow, and every bit as sweet
as honey. Our Sugar Canes were no lesse pleasing unto us, whilst chewing the pith, we
refreshed and sweetned our mouthes with the juice. We fed for the first week almost
upon nothing but <i>Tortois</i>; which seemed likewise to us that had never before seen it,
one of the Sea monsters, the Shell being so hard as to beare any Cart wheel, and in some
above two yards broad; when first they were opened, we were amazed to see the number
of egges that were in them, a thousand being the least that we judged to be in some
of them. Our <i>Spaniards</i> made with them an excellent broth with all sorts of spices. The
meat seemed rather flesh then Sea fish, which being corned with salt, and hung up two
or three dayes in the aire, tasted like Veal. Thus our Hens, our Sheep, our powdred
Beef, and gammons of Bacon, which we brought from <i>Spain</i>, were some dayes slighted,
while with greedy stomacks we fell hard to our Sea Veale.</p>

<p>After foure dayes sail, our Fryer <i>John de la Cueva</i>, who had been shot by the <i>Indians</i>,
died; all his body being swelled, which gave us just occasion to thinke, that the arrow
which was shot into his shoulder was poisoned. His buriall was as solemnly performed
as could be at Sea. His grave being the whole Ocean, he had weighty stones hung
to his feet, two more to his shoulders, and one to his brest; and then the superstitious
<i>Romish Dirige</i> and <i>Requiem</i> being sung for his soul, his Corpse being held out to the Sea
on the ship side, with ropes ready to let him fall, all the ship crying out three times, <i>buen
Viaie</i> (that is, a good Voiage) to his soul chiefly, and also to his Corpse ready to travail
to the deep to feed the Whales; at the first cry all the Ordnance were shot off, the ropes
on a suddain loosed, and <i>John de la Cueva</i> with the weight of heavy stones plunged
deep into the Sea, whom no mortall eyes ever more beheld. The like we saw performed
in the ship of <i>Santa Gertrudis</i>, to another Jesuite, one of the three who had been
dangerously wounded by the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Guadalupe</i>; who likewise died like our Fryer,
his body being swelled as with poyson. Now our sailing was more comfortable then
before; for we passed in the sight of the land of <i>Puerto Rico</i>, and then of the great
Island of <i>Sto. Domingo</i>; and here our company began to be lessened, some departing
to <i>Puerto Rico</i>, and <i>Sto. Domingo</i>, others to <i>Cartagena</i>, and <i>Havana</i>, and <i>Honduras, Jamaica</i>,
and <i>Jucatan</i>. We remained now alone the Fleet for <i>Mexico</i>; and so sailed till we
came to what the <i>Spaniards</i> call <i>la Sonda</i>, or the sound of <i>Mexico</i>; for here we often sounded
the Sea; which was so calme, that a whole week we were stayed for want of wind,
scarce stirring from the place where first we were caught by the calme. Here likewise
we had great sport in fishing, filling again our bellies with <i>Dorados</i>, and saving that
provision which we had brought from <i>Spain</i>. But the heat was so extraordinary, that
the day was no pleasure unto us; for the repercussion of the suns heat upon the still
water and pitch of our ships, kindled a scorching fire, which all the day
distempered our bodies with a constant running sweat, forcing us to cast
off most of our clothes. The evenings and nights were somewhat more comfortable,
yet the heat which the sun had left in the pitched ribs and plankes of the ship was
such, that under deck and in our Cabins wee were not able to sleep, but in our shirts
were forced to walke, or sit, or lie upon the deck. The Mariners fell to washing themselves
and to swimming, till the infortunate death of one in the ship called <i>St. Francisco</i>,
made them suddainly leave off that sport. The neerer wee come to the main land, the
sea abounds with a monstrous fish called by the <i>Spaniards, Tiburon</i>. Some mistake
this fish for the <i>Caiman</i>, or <i>Crocodile</i>, holding them both for one; and thinking that
it is only the <i>Caiman</i> or <i>Crocodile</i> (by abuse called <i>Tiburon</i>) which devoures mans flesh,
a whole joynt at a bit in the water. But the mistake is grosse, for the <i>Caiman</i> is plated
all over with shells, whereas the <i>Tiburon</i> hath no shells, but only like other great Sea
fishes, hath a thick skin. The <i>Caiman</i> though the <i>Indians</i> eat of it, yet the <i>Spaniards</i>
hate it; who eat of the <i>Tiburon</i>; and in our ship catching one with a tridentall iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Fork, and haling him with a Cable rope to the ship side, and then binding him with
it, (being as much as a dozen or fifteen men could do to hoise him up into the ship) we
found him to be a most monstrous creature, twelve els long at least, which we salted, and
found likewise to eat like flesh, as hath been said of the <i>Tortois</i>. This kind is as ravenous
after mans flesh as the <i>Crocodile</i>, and many of them were to be seen in this Sound
of <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Spaniards</i> bathing themselves dayly by the ships side, (where there is no such
danger of the <i>Tiburon</i>; who useth not to come too neere the ships) one Mariner of
the ship called <i>St. Francisco</i> being more venturous then the rest, and offering to
swimme from his ship, to see some friends in another not farre off, chanced
to be a most unfortunate prey to one of them, who before any boat could be
set out to help him, was thrice seen to bee pulled under water by the Monster, who had
devoured a leg, an arme, and part of his shoulder; the rest of the body was after
found and taken up, and carried to <i>S. Francisco</i>, and there buried in the forme and
manner as hath been said of our Fryer <i>John de la Cueva. They that goe downe to the sea
in ships, these see the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe, Ps.</i> 107. 23, 24.
Here they shall see not only Whales, but other Fishes like Monsters mastering
strong and valiant men, with severall sets of sharpe, strong and mighty teeth, devouring at
one bit whole limmes with flesh and bones together. This mischance sadded all our
Fleet for three daies till it pleased God to refresh our burning heat with a cool and prosperous
wind, driving us out of that calm Sound, which (if we had continued in it with
that excessive heat) might have proved most unsound and unhealthy to our bodies.
Three daies after we had sailed, being Munday in the morning about seven of the
clock, one of our Fryers saying Masse, and all the people in the ship kneeling to hear
it, and to adore their bread God, one Mariner with a loud and suddain voice crieth
out <i>Tierra, Tierra, Tierra</i>, Land, Land, Land, which rejoyced the hearts of all that were
in the ship, as it seemed, more then their Masse, for leaving that, and their God upon
the Altar with the Preist to eat him alone, they arose from their knees, to behold the
Continent of <i>America</i>. Great was the joy of all the ships that day; and great was the
slaughter which our old <i>Calvo</i> made among his fowles, (which he had spared formerly)
to feast that day his Fryers. About ten of the clock the whole face of the land was
visibly apparent, and wee with full sale running to imbrace it. But our wise Admirall
knowing the danger of the Coast, and especially the dangerous entring into the Haven,
by reason of the many rockes that lie about it, and are known only by markes
and flags set out to give all ships warning of them; perceiving that with the wind
wherewith wee sailed then, we should not come till towards evening to the Port: and lastly,
fearing lest some North-wind (which is dangerous upon that Coast, and ordinary in
the month of <i>September</i>) should in the night arise, and endanger all our ships upon the
rockes; he therefore called to Councell all the Pilots, to know whether it were best to
keep on our sailing with full sail that day, with hopes to get that day in good time into
the Haven, or else with the middle sail only to draw neer, that the next morning
with more security wee might with the help of boats from land be guided in. The result
of the Councell was not to venture that day too neer unto the Port, for fear of being
benighted, but to pull down all, but the middle sail. The wind began to calme,
and our ships to move slowly towards land, and so we continued till night. A double
watch was kept that night in our ship, and the Pilot was more watchfull himselfe and
more carefull then at other times; But our Fryers betooke themselves to their rest; which
continued not long; for before midnight the wind turned to the North, which caused
a suddain and generall cry and uproar in ours, and all the other ships. Our Mariners
came to the Fryers, using almost the same words of Jonah 1. 6. <i>What meanest thou, O
sleeper? Arise call upon thy God, if so bee that God will thinke upon us, that we perish not.</i>
They changed the name of God into the blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>, in whom they seeme
to confide in such occasions more then in God himselfe. Their feare was more for the
apprehension of danger by that kind of wind, and of what might happen, then for
what as yet the wind threatned, which was not strong nor boisterous; however hallowed
wax candles were lighted by the Fryers, knees bowed to <i>Mary</i>, Letanies and other
hymnes and prayers sung aloud unto her, till towards the dawning of the day; when
behold the North wind ceased, our wonted gale began to blow again, it being Gods
will and pleasure, and no effect of the howling Fryers prayers to <i>Mary</i>, who yet superstitiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to deceive the simple people, cryed out, <i>Milagro, Milagro, Milagro,</i> a miracle,
a miracle, a miracle. By eight a clock in the morning wee came to the sight of
the houses, and made signes for boats to convey us into the Haven; which immediately
with great joy came out, and guided us one by one between those Rockes, which
make that Port as dangerous as any I have discovered in all my travailes both upon the
North and South sea. Our Waits plaied most pleasantly, our Ordnance saluted both
Towne and Fort over against it, our hearts and countenances reciprocally rejoyced;
wee cast our Anchors, which yet were not enough to secure our ships in that most dangerous
Haven, but further with Cable ropes we secured them to Iron rings, which for
that purpose are fastned into the Wall of the Fort, for feare of the strong and boisterous
Northerne winds. And thus welcoming one another to a new world, many
boates waiting for us, we presently went with joy to set footing in <i>America</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Of our Landing at</i> Vera Crux, <i>otherwise St.</i> John de Ulhua, <i>and of our entertainment
there.</i></h4>


<p>Upon the 12 day of <i>September</i>, we happily arrived in <i>America</i> in that famous
Towne, called <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, otherwise <i>Vera Crux</i>; famous for
that it was the first beginning of the famous conquest of that valiant and ever
renowned Conqueror <i>Hernando Cortez</i>. Here first was that noble and generous
resolution, that never heard of policy, to sinke the ships, which had brought the
first <i>Spaniards</i> to that Continent, greater then any of the other three parts of the
world, to the intent that they might thinke of nothing but such a conquest as after
followed, being destitute of the helpe of their ships, and without hopes evermore to
returne to <i>Cuba, Yucatan</i>, or any of those parts from whence they had come. Here
it was, that the first five hundred <i>Spaniards</i> strengthned themselves against millions of
enemies, and against the biggest fourth part of all the world. Here were the first Magistrates,
Judges, Aldermen, Officers of Justice named. The proper name of the
Towne is <i>S. John de Ulhua</i>, otherwise called <i>Vera Crux</i>, from the old Harbour and
Haven of <i>Vera Crux</i>, six leagues from this, and so called for that upon good Friday
it was first discovered. But the old <i>Vera Crux</i> proving too dangerous an Harbour for
ships, by reason of the violence of the Northern winds; it was utterly forsaken by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who removed to <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, where their ships found the first safe road
by reason of a Rocke, which is a strong defence against the winds. And because the
memory of the worke of that good Friday should never be forgotten; to <i>S. John de Ulhua</i>
they have added the name also of <i>Vera Crux</i>, taken from that first Haven which was
discovered upon good Friday, <i>Anno</i> 1519.</p>

<p>As soone as we came to shore, wee found very solemne preparations for entertainment,
all the Towne being resorted to the Sea side, all the Preists and Canons of the
Cathedrall Church, all the religious Orders of the severall Convents (which are
there Dominicans, Franciscans, Mercenarians, and Jesuites) being in a readinesse
with their Crosses borne before them, to guide the new Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>, in procession
to the chiefe Cathedrall Church. The Fryers and Jesuites were quicker in going
to land then the great <i>Don</i> the Marquesse <i>de Serralvo</i> and his Lady. Some of them
kissed the ground as holy in their opinion, for the Conversion of those <i>Indians</i> to Christianity,
who before had worshipped Idols, and sacrificed to Devils; others kneeled
upon their knees making short prayers, some to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, others to such Saints
as they best affected; and so betooke themselves to the places and stations of those of
their profession. In the mean time all the Cannon playing both from ships and Castle,
landed the Viceroy and his Lady and all his Traine, acccompanyed with <i>Don Martin de
Carrillo</i> the Visiter generall for the strife between the Count of <i>Gelves</i> the last Viceroy, &amp;
the Archbishop of <i>Mexico</i>. The great Don and his Lady being placed under a Canope of
state, began the <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung with much variety of musicall instruments, all marching
in procession to the Cathedrall, where with many lights of burning lampes, torches,
&amp; Wax candles, was to the view of all set upon the high Altar their God of bread;
to whom all knees were bowed; a prayer of thanks-giving sung, holy water by a Preist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
sprinkled upon all the people, and lastly a Masse with three Preists solemnly celebrated.
This being ended the Viceroy was attended on by the Chief High Justice, named <i>Alcalde</i>
Major by the Officers of the Town, some Judges sent from <i>Mexico</i> to that purpose,
and all the Souldiers of the Ships and Town unto his lodging; The Fryers likewise
in Procession with their Crosse before them were conducted to their severall Cloisters.
Fryer <i>Calvo</i> presented his Dominicans to the Prior of the Cloister of St. <i>Dominicke</i>, who
entertained us very lovingly with some sweet Meates, and everyone with a Cup of
the <i>Indian</i> drink called <i>Chocolatte</i>, whereof I shall speake hereafter. This refreshment
being ended, wee proceeded to a better, which was a most stately Dinner both of Fish
and Flesh; no Fowles were spared, many Capons, Turky Cocks, and Hens were prodigally
lavished, to shew us the abundance and plenty of Provision of that Country. The
Prior of this Cloister was no stayed, ancient, grey-headed man, such as usually are
made Superiours to govern young and wanton Fryers; but hee was a Gallant and Amorous
young Sparke, who (as wee were there informed) had obtained from his Superiour
the Provinciall the Government of that Convent with a Bribe of a thousand Duckats.
After dinner hee had some of us to his Chamber, where wee observed his lightnesse
and little savour of Religion or Mortification in him; We thought to have found
in his Chamber some stately Library, which might tel us of Learning and love of Study;
but we found not above a dozen old Bookes, standing in a corner covered with dust and
Cobwebs, as if they were ashamed that the Treasure that lay hid in them, should be so
much forgotten, and undervalued, and the Guitarra (the <i>Spanish</i> Lute) preferred and
set above them. His Chamber was richly dressed and hung with many pictures, and
with hangings, some made with Cotten Wooll, others with various coloured feathers
of <i>Mechoacan</i>, his Tables covered with Carpets of Silk; his Cubboards adorned with
severall sorts of <i>China</i> Cups and Dishes, stored within with severall dainties of sweet
Meates and Conserves.</p>

<p>This sight seemed to the zealous Fryers of our Mission most vaine, and unbeseeming
a poore and mendicant Fryer; to the others, whose end in comming from <i>Spain</i> to
those parts was Liberty, and loosnesse, and covetousnesse of riches, this sight was pleasing
and gave them great incouragement to enter further into that Country, where
soone a Mendicant <i>Lazarus</i> might become a proud and wealthy <i>Dives</i>. The discourse
of the young and light headed Prior was nothing but vaine boasting of himself, of his
birth, his parts, his favour with the chiefe Superior or Provinciall, the love which the
best Ladies, the richest Merchants Wives of the Towne bare unto him, of his
cleere and excellent voice, and great dexterity in Musick, whereof he presently gave
us a taste, tuning his <i>Guitarra</i> and singing to us some verses (as hee said, of his owne
composing) some lovely <i>Amaryllis</i>, adding scandall to scandall, loosenesse to liberty,
which it grieved some of us to see in a Superiour who should have taught with words,
and in his life and Conversation examples of Repentance and Mortification. No sooner
were our senses of hearing delighted well with Musick, our Sight with the objects of
Cotten-Wool, Silke and Feather workes, but presently our Prior caused to be brought
forth of all his store of dainties, such variety as might likewise relish well and delight
our sense of tasting. Thus as wee were truely transported from <i>Europe</i> to <i>America</i>, so
the World seemed truely to bee altered, our senses changed from what they were the
night &amp; day before when we heard the hideous noise of the Mariners hoising up Sailes,
when wee saw the deep and monsters of it, when we tasted the stinking water, when
we smelt the Tarre and Pitch; but here wee heard a quivering and trembling voice and
instrument well tuned, wee beheld wealth and riches, wee tasted what was sweet, and
in the Sweet-meates smelt the Muske and Civit, wherewith that Epicurean Prior had
seasoned his Conserves. Here wee broke up our discourse and pastimes, desirous to
walke abroad and take a view of the Towne, having no more time then that, and the
next day to stay in it. Wee compassed it round about that afternoone; and found the
situation of it to bee sandy, except on the South-West side, where it is Moorish ground,
and full of standing Bogs, which with the great heates that are there, cause it to bee a
very unhealthy place; The number of Inhabitants may bee three thousand, and amongst
them some very rich Merchants, some worth two hundred, some three hundred, and
some foure hundred thousand Duckats. Of the buildings little we observed, for they
are all, both Houses, Churches, and Cloisters built with Boards and Timber, the Walls
of the richest mans house being made but of boards, which with the impetuous Winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
from the North hath bin cause that many times the town hath bin for the most part of it
burnt down to the ground. The great Trading from <i>Mexico</i>, &amp; by <i>Mexico</i> from the <i>East-India's</i>,
from <i>Spain</i>, from <i>Cuba, Sto. Domingo, Jucatan, Portabello</i>, and by <i>Portabello</i> from
<i>Peru</i>, from <i>Cartagena</i> and all the Islands lying upon the North Sea, and by the River <i>Alvarado</i>
going up to <i>Zapotecas, St. Ildefonso</i>, and towards <i>Guaxaca</i>, and by the River <i>Grijalva</i>,
running up to <i>Tabasco, Los Zoques</i> and <i>Chiapa de Indios</i>, maketh this little Town
very rich, and to abound with all the Commodities of the Continent Land, and of all
the <i>East</i> and <i>West-India's</i> Treasures. The unhealthinesse of the place is the reason of
the paucity of Inhabitants, and the paucity of them, together with the rich Trading
and commerce, the reasons that the Merchants therein are extraordinary rich; who
yet might have been farre richer, had not the Town been so often fired, and they in the
fire had great losses. All the strength of this Towne is first the hard and dangerous entrance
into the Haven; and secondly, a rock which lyeth before the Town lesse then a
Musket shot off; upon which is built a Castle, and in the Castle a slight Garrison of
Souldiers. In the Town there is neither Fort, nor Castle, nor scarce any people of
warlike mindes. The Rocke and Castle are as a Wall, defence, and inclosure to the
Haven, which otherwise lyeth wide open to the Ocean, and to the Northern Winds.
No Ship dares cast anchor within the Haven, but onely under the Rock and Castle,
and yet not sure enough so with Anchors, except with Cables also they be bound and
fastened to Rings of Iron for that purpose to the side of the Rock; from whence sometimes
it hath happened that Ships floating with the Stream too much on one side the
Rocke have been driven off and cast upon the other Rockes or out to the Ocean, the
Cables of their Anchors, and those wherewith they have beene fastned to the Castle
being broken with the force of the Winds. This happened to one of our Ships the
first night after we landed; who were happy that we were not then at Sea; for there arose
such a storme and Tempest from the North, that it quite broke the Cables of one Ship
and drove it out to the maine Sea, and wee thought it would have blowne and droven
us out of our beds after it, for the slight boarded houses did so totter &amp; shake, that we expected
every houre when they would fal upon our heads. We had that first night enough
of St. <i>John de Ulhua</i>, and little rest, though feasted as well at Supper as at Dinner by
our vaine boasting Prior, who before wee went to bed, had caused all our feet to bee
washed, that now in easier beds then for above two moneths together the strait and
narrow Cabins of the Ship had allowed us, our sleep might be more quiet, and more
nourishing to our bodies; but the whistling Winds and tottering Chambers, which
made our Beds uneasie Cradles to us, caused us to flie from our rest at midnight, and
with our bare (though washed) feet to seeke the dirty Yard for safer shelter. In the
morning the Fryers of the Cloister who were acquainted with those winds and storms,
laughed at our fearefulnesse, assuring us, that they never slept better then when their
Beds were rocked with such like blasts. But that nights affrightment made us weary
already of our good and kind entertainment; wee desired to remove from the Sea side;
which our Superiour <i>Calvo</i> yeelded to, not for our feare sake so much, as for his feare,
lest with eating too much of the fruits of that Countrey, and drinking after them too
greedily of the water (which causeth dangerous Fluxes, and hasteneth death to those
that newly come from <i>Spain</i> to those parts) wee should fall sick, and die there, as hundreds
did after our departure for want of temperance in the use of those fruits, which
before they had never seen, or eaten. Thirty Mules were ready for us, which had
bin brought a purpose from <i>Mexico</i>, and had waited for us in St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> six days
before ever the Fleet arrived. <i>Calvo</i> that day busied himselfe a Ship board in sending to
shore our Chests, and such Provision as had been left of Wines, and Bisket, Gammons
of Bacon, and salted Beefe, whereof there was some store, besides a dozen Hens and three
Sheep, which was much wondred at, that so much should be left after so long a voiage.
In the mean time we visited our friends and tooke our leaves of them in the forenoone;
and after Dinner seats were prepared for us in the Cathedrall Church to sit and see a
Comedy acted, which had beene on purpose studied and prepared by the Town for
the entertainment of the new Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>. Thus two daies onely we abode in
St. <i>John de Ulhua</i>, and so departed.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_IX" id="CHAP_IX">CHAP. IX.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Of our journey from St.</i> John de Ulhua <i>to</i> Mexico; <i>and of the most remarkeable
Townes and Villages in the way.</i></h4>


<p>Upon the 14 day of <i>September</i> we left the Town and Port of <i>S. John de Ulhua</i>, entring
into the rode to <i>Mexico</i>, which we found the first three or four leagues
to bee very sandy, as wide and open as is our rode from <i>London</i> to <i>S. Albans</i>.
The first <i>Indians</i> we met with, was at the old <i>Vera Crux</i>, a Towne seated
by the sea side, which the <i>Spaniards</i> that first conquered that countrey thought to have
made their chief Harbour: but afterwards by reason of the small shelter they found in it
for their ships against the North winds, they left it, and removed to <i>S. John de Ulhua</i>.
Here we began to discover the power of the Preists and Fryers over the poore <i>Indians</i>,
and their subjection and obedience unto them. The Prior of <i>S. John de Ulhua</i> had
writ a letter unto them the day before of our passing that way, charging them to meet
us in the way, and to welcome us into those parts; which was by the poor <i>Indians</i> gallantly
performed; for two miles before we came to the Towne, there met us on Horse-back
some twenty of the chiefe of the Towne, presenting unto every one of us a nosegay
of flowers; who rid before us a bow shot, till we met with more company on
foot, to wit, the Trumpeters, the Waits; (who sounded pleasantly all the way before
us) the Officers of the Church, such as here we call Church-wardens, though
more in number, according to the many sodalities or confraternities of Saints whom
they serve, these likewise presented to each of us a nosegay; next met us the singing
men and boyes, all the Quiristers, who softly and leisurely walked before us singing,
<i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, till we came to the midst of the Towne, where were two great
Elme trees, the chiefe Market place; there was set up one long arbour with green bowes,
and a table ready furnished with boxes of conserves, and other sweet meates, and diet-bread,
to prepare our stomacks for a cup of <i>Chocolatte</i>, which while it was seasoning
with the hot water and Sugar, the chiefe <i>Indians</i> and Officers of the Towne made a
speech unto us, having first kneeled downe and kissed our hands one by one; they welcomed
us into their Countrey, calling us the Apostles of Jesus Christ, thanked us for
that we had left our own Countrey, our friends, our fathers and mothers for to save
their soules; they told us they honoured us as Gods upon earth; and many such complements
they used till our <i>Chocolatte</i> was brought. We refreshed ourselves for the space
of one hour, and gave hearty thanks to the <i>Indians</i> for their kind respects unto us, assuring
them that nothing was more deare unto us in this world then their souls, which
that we might save, wee regarded not sea, nor land dangers, nor the unhumane cruelties
of barbarous and savage <i>Indians</i>, (who as yet had no knowledge of the true God)
no nor our owne lives.</p>

<p>And thus we took our leaves, giving unto the chief of them some Beads, some medals,
some Crosses of brasse, some <i>Agnus Dei</i>, some reliques brought from <i>Spain</i>, and to every
one of the Town an Indulgence of fourty years, (which the Pope had granted unto
us, to bestow where, and upon whom, and as often as wee would) wherewith we began
to blind that simple people with ignorant, erroneous, and Popish principles. As we went
out of the Arbour to take our Mules, behold the Market place was full of <i>Indian</i> men and
women; who as they saw us ready to depart, kneeled upon the ground as adoring us
for a blessing, which as we rid along, we bestowed upon them with lifted up hands on
high, making over them the signe of the Crosse. And this submission of the poor <i>Indians</i>
unto the Preists in those parts; this vain-glory in admitting such ceremonious
entertainment and publike worship from them, did so puffe up some of our young Fryers
hearts, that already they thought themselves better then the best Bishops in <i>Spain</i>,
who though proud enough, yet never travail there with such publike acclamations as
we did. The Waits and Trumpets sounded againe before us, and the chiefe of the
Town conducted us a mile forward, and so tooke their leaves. The first two daies we
lodged but in poore small <i>Indian</i> Townes, among whom we still found kind entertainment,
and good store of provision, especially of Hens, Capons, Turkeys, and severall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sorts of fruits. The third day at night we came to a great Towne consisting of
neere two thousand inhabitants, some <i>Spaniards</i>, some <i>Indians</i>, called <i>Xalappa de la
Vera Crux</i>. This Towne in the yeare 1634. was made a new Bishops Sea (the Bishoprick
of the City, called <i>La Puebla de los Angeles</i> being divided into two) and this being
not above the third part of it, is thought to be worth ten thousand duckats a
yeer. It stands in a very fertile soile for <i>Indian</i> wheat called <i>Maiz</i>, and some <i>Spanish</i>
wheat. There are many Townes about it of <i>Indians</i>; but what makes it rich, are the
many farmes of Sugar, and some which they call <i>Estantia's</i>, rich farmes for breeding
of Mules, and cattell; and likewise some Farmes of <i>Cochinil</i>. In this Towne there
is but one great Church and an inferiour Chappell, both belonging to a Cloister of
Franciscan Friers, wherein we were lodged that night and the next day, being the
Lords day. Though the revenues of this Cloister be great, yet it maintaines not above
halfe a dozen Fryers, where twenty might be plentifully maintained, that so
those few lubbers might be more abundantly, and like Epicures fed and nourished.
The Superiour or Guardian of this Cloister was no lesse vaine then the Prior of <i>S. John
de Ulhua</i>; and though he were not of our profession, yet he welcomed us with stately
entertainment. Here and wheresoever further we travailed, we still found in the
Preists and Fryers loosenesse of life, and their waies and proceedings contrary to the
waies of their profession, sworne to by a solemne Vow and Covenant. This Order
especially of the mendicant Franciscan Fryers voweth (besides chastity and obedience)
poverty more strictly to be observed, then any other Order of the <i>Romish</i> Church; for
their Clothing ought to be corse sackcloth, their girdles made of hemp should be no
finer then strong halters, their shirts should be but woollen, their legs should know
no stockings, their feet no shoes, but at the most and best either wooden clogs, or sandals
of hemp, their hands and fingers should not so much as touch any money, nor they
have the use or possession or propriety of any, nor their journeys be made easy with
the help of Horses to carry them, but painfully they ought to travaile on foot; and
the breach of any of these they acknowledge to be a deadly and mortall sinne, with
the guilt of a high soul-damning and soul-cursing excommunication. Yet for all
these bonds and obligations, those wretched Impes live in those parts as though they
had never vowed unto the Lord, shewing in their lives that they have vowed what
they are not able to performe. It was to us a strange and scandalous sight to see here in
<i>Xalappa</i> a Fryer of the Cloister riding in with his lackey boy by his side, upon a goodly
gelding, (having gone but to the Townes end, as we were informed, to heare a dying
mans confession) with his long habit tucked up to his girdle, making shew of a fine
silke orange colour stockin upon his legs, and a neate Cordovan shoe upon his foot,
with a fine Holland paire of drawers, with a lace three inches broad at knee. This
sight made us willing to pry further into this and the other Fryers carriages, under
whose broad sleeves we could perceive their dublets quilted with silke, and at their wrists
the laces of their Holland shirts. In their talke we could discerne no mortification, but
meer vanity and worldlinesse. After supper some of them began to talk of carding and
dicing; they challenged us, that were but new comers to those parts, to a Primera; which
though most of ours refused, some for want of money, some for ignorance of that game,
yet at last with much ado they got two of our Fryers to joyn with two of theirs; so the
cards were handsomely shuffled, the vies and revies were doubled, losse made some hot &amp;
blind with passion, gain made others eager and covetous; and thus was that religious
Cloister made all night a gaming house, and sworne religious poverty turned into profane
and worldly covetousnesse. We that beheld some part of the night the game, found
enough to observe, for the more the sport increased, scandalls to the sport were added,
both by drinking and swearing that common oath <i>Voio a Christo, Voio a Dios</i>, and
also by scoffing and jearing at the religious vowes of poverty which they had vowed;
for one of the Franciscans though formerly he had touched money, and with his fingers
had laid it to the Stake on the table; yet sometimes to make the company laugh,
if he had chanced to winne a double vie (and sometimes the vies and revies went round
of twenty patacons) then would he take the end of one sleeve of his habit, and open
wide the other broad sleeve, and so with his sleeve sweep the money into his other
sleeve, saying, I have vowed not to touch money, nor to keep any, I meaned then a
naturall contact of it; but my sleeve may touch it, and my sleeve may keep it: shewing
with scoffes and jests of his lips, what religion was in his heart. My eares tingled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
hearing such oathes, my tongue would have uttered some words of reproofe, but that I
considered my self a guest and stranger in a strange house, and that if any thing I should
say, it would doe no good; so silently I departed to my rest, leaving the Gamesters,
who continued til Sun-rising, and in the morning I was informed that the jesting Fryer,
that rather roaring Boy then religious Franciscan, fitter for <i>Sardanapalus</i> or <i>Epicurus</i> his
Schoole, then to live in a Cloister, had lost fourescore and odde Patacons, his sleeve
(it seemes) refusing to keep for him what hee had vowed never to possesse. Here I began
to find out by experience of these Franciscans, that liberty and loosnesse of life it
was that brought yeerly so many Fryers and Jesuites from <i>Spain</i> to those parts, rather
then zeale of Preaching the Gospel and Converting Soules to Christ, which indeed being
an act of highest Charity, they make a speciall badge of the truth of their Religion:
But the loosnesse of their lives sheweth evidently that the love of money, of vain-glory,
of Power and Authority over the poore <i>Indians</i>, is their end and aime more then any
love of God. From <i>Xalappa</i> we went to a place called by the <i>Spaniards, La Rinconada</i>,
which is no Towne nor Village, and therefore not worth mentioning in such a Rode as
now I am in; yet as famous in two things, it must not bee omitted amongst greater
places. This place stands so far from any other Town, that Travellers can scarce make
their journeys without either baiting there at noone, or lying there at night, or declining
three or foure miles out of the Rode to some <i>Indian</i> Town. It is no
more then one house, which the <i>Spaniards</i> call, <i>Venta</i>, or as our <i>English</i>, Innes, seated in the corner
of a low Valley, which is the hottest place from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to <i>Mexico</i>; about it
are the best Springs and Fountaines in all the Rode, and the water though warme with
the heat of the Sun, yet as sweet as any Milk. The Inne-keepers knowing wel the <i>Spaniards</i>
heat, that it seeks coole and refreshing drink, have speciall care so to lay in water in great
earthen Vessels, which they set upon a moist and waterish Sand, that it is so cold that it
maketh the teeth to chatter. This sweetnesse and this coolnesse together of that water in
so hot and scorching a Countrey, was to us a wonder, who could find no other refreshment
from that extraordinary heat. Besides our Provision here of Beefe, Mutton, Kid,
Hens, Turkeys, Rabbets, Fowles, and especially Quailes, was so plentifull and cheape,
that wee were astonished at it. The Valley and Countrey about it is very rich and
fertile, full of <i>Spanish</i> Farmes of Sugar, and <i>Cochinil, Spanish</i> and <i>Indian</i> Wheate.
But what maketh mee more especially remember this <i>Venta</i>, or Inne, is, for that
though Art and experience of man have found a way to provide for Travellers in so hot
a place coole and refreshing water, and God have given it the sweetnesse of Milk, and
to the place such abundance of Provision; yet all this in the day onely is comfortable
and pleasant; but in the night the <i>Spaniards</i> call it, <i>Cumfites en infierno</i>, that is to say,
Cumfits in hell, for not onely the heat is so extraordinary, that it is impossible to bee
feeding without wiping away the continuall sweat of the Face, whose drops from
the Browes are alwayes ready to blind our eyes and to fill with sauce our dishes, but
the swarmes of Gnats are such that waking and sleeping no device of man is able to
keep them off. True it is, most of us had our Pavilions which wee carried with us to
hang about and over our beds, but these could not defend us from that piercing and
stinging Vermine, which like <i>Egypts</i> Plague of Frogs would be sure to be in every place,
and through our Curtaines to come upon our very Beds. Yet in the day they are
not; but just at Sun setting they begin to swarme about, and at Sun rising away they
goe. After a most tedious and troublesome night, when wee found the rising of the
Sun had dispersed and banished them away, wee thought it best for us to flie away from
that place with them; and so from thence earely wee departed to a Towne as pleasant
and fertill and abounding with Provision as this <i>Rinconada</i>, and free from such busie
guests and individuall Mates and Companions as the night before had intruded themselves
upon us. The next night wee got to a Towne called <i>Segura</i>, inhabited both by
<i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>, consisting of about a thousand Inhabitants; here again without
any charges we were stately entertained by Franciscan Fryers, as light and vain glorious
as those of <i>Xalappa</i>. This Town had its first beginning and foundation from <i>Hernando
Cortez</i>, and is called <i>Segura de la Frontera</i>, being built up by him for a Frontier Town
to secure the <i>Spaniards</i> that came from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, against the <i>Culhuacans</i>
and people of <i>Tepeacac</i>, who were allied to the <i>Mexicans</i>, and so much annoyed
the <i>Spaniards</i>. But what most incensed <i>Cortez</i> was, that after his first repulse from <i>Mexico</i>,
the <i>Indians</i> insulting over him and the rest of his Company, whom they heard had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
beene dangerously wounded, and were retired to <i>Tlaxcallan</i> to recover and strengthen
themselves; the two Townes, <i>Culhua</i> and <i>Tepeacac</i>, then in League with the <i>Mexicans</i>
against <i>Cortez</i> and the Town of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, lying in wait for the <i>Spaniards</i>, took
twelve of them, and sacrificed them alive to their Idols and eat their flesh. Whereupon
<i>Cortez</i> desired <i>Maxixca</i>, a chief Captain of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, and divers other Gentlemen
of that Towne to goe with him and to help him to bee avenged of the people
of <i>Tepeacac</i> for the cruelty used to twelve of his <i>Spaniards</i>, and for the daily and great
hurt they also did to the Inhabitants of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> with the helpe of their allied friends
the <i>Culhuacans</i> and <i>Mexicans. Maxixca</i> and the chief of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> forthwith entred
into counsell with the States and and Communalty of the Town, and there determined
with generall consent to give unto him forty thousand fighting Men, besides many <i>Tamemez</i>,
who are Foot Carriers, to beare the Baggage, Victuall, and other things.
With this number of <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>, his owne men, and horses, <i>Cortez</i> went to <i>Tepeacac</i>,
requiring them in satisfaction of the death of the twelve Christians, that they should
now yeeld themselves to the obedience of the Emperour and King of <i>Spain</i> his Master,
and hereafter never more to receive any <i>Mexican</i> into their Town or houses, neither yet
any of the Province of <i>Culhua</i>. The <i>Tepeacacs</i> answered that they had slain the <i>Spaniards</i>
for good and just cause, which was that being time of Warre, they presumed to
passe through their Countrey by force without their will and License. And also that
the <i>Mexicans</i> and <i>Culhuacans</i> were their friends and Lords, whom alwayes they would
friendly entertaine within their Towne and houses, refusing utterly their offer and request,
protesting to give no obedience to whom they knew not, wishing them therefore
to return incontinent to <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, except they had desire to end their weary days,
and to be sacrificed and eaten up as their twelve friends had been. <i>Cortez</i> yet invited
them many times with peace; and seeing it prevailed not, he began his Wars in earnest.
The <i>Tepeacacs</i> with the favour of the <i>Culhuacans</i> were brave and lusty, and began to
stop and defend the <i>Spaniards</i> entrance into their Town. And being many in number
with divers valiant men among them, began to skirmish sundry times; but at the end
they were overthrown and many slain without killing any <i>Spaniard</i>, although many
<i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> were killed that day. The Lords and principall persons of <i>Tepeacac</i> seeing
their overthrow, and that their strength could not prevaile, yeelded themselves
unto <i>Cortez</i> for Vassals of the Emperour with condition to banish for ever their allied
friends of <i>Culhua</i>; and that hee should punish and correct at his will and pleasure all
those which were occasion of the death of the twelve <i>Spaniards</i>. For which causes and
obstinacy, at the first <i>Cortez</i> judged by his sentence that all the Townes which had
been privy to the murther, should for ever remain Captives and slaves; others affirm
that he overcame them without any condition, and corrected them for their disobedience,
being Sodomites, Idolaters and eaters of mans flesh, and chiefly for example of all
others. And in conclusion, they were condemned for slaves, and within twenty daies that
these Wars lasted, hee pacified all that Province, which is very great, hee drave from
thence the <i>Culhuacans</i>, hee threw down the Idols, and the chiefest persons obeyed him.
And for more assurance he built there this Town, naming it <i>Segura De la Frontera</i>, appointing
all Officers for the purpose, whereby the Christians and strangers might passe
without danger from <i>Vera Crux</i> to <i>Mexico</i>. This Town likewise, as all the rest from
St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, is very plentifull of provision, and many sorts of fruits,
namely Plantins, <i>Sapottes</i>, and <i>Chicosapottes</i>, which have within a great black kernell as
big as our horse Plums, the fruit it self is as red within as Scarlet, as sweet as Honey;
but the <i>Chicosapotte</i>, is lesse and some of them red, some browne coloured, and so juicy
that at the eating the juyce like drops of Honey fall from them, and the smell is
like unto a baked Peare. Here likewise were presented unto us Clusters of Grapes as
faire as any in <i>Spain</i>, which were welcome unto us, for that wee had seen none since we
came from <i>Spain</i>, and wee saw by them that the Countrey thereabouts would be very
fit for Vineyards, if the King of <i>Spain</i> would grant the planting of Vines in those
parts; which often hee hath refused to doe, lest the Vineyards there should hinder
the Trading and Trafique between <i>Spain</i> and those parts, which certainly had they
but Wine, needed not any commerce with <i>Spain</i>. This Towne is of a more temperate
Climate then any other from <i>Vera Crux</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, and the people who formerly
had been eaters of Mans flesh, now as civill and politick, as loving and curteous as any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in the rode. From whence we declined a little out of our way more Westward (the
rode being North-Westward) only to see that famous Towne of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, whose
inhabitants joyned with <i>Cortez</i>, and wee may say were the chiefe instruments of that
great and unparalleld Conquest.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_X" id="CHAP_X">CHAP. X.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Wherein is set downe the estate and condition of the great Towne of</i> Tlaxcallan,
<i>when the first</i> Spaniards <i>entred the Empire of</i> Mexico; Cortez <i>his first encounter
with the</i> Tlaxcalteca's; <i>their league with him, with a description of
the Towne; and of the state and condition of it now.</i></h4>


<p><i>Tlaxcallan</i> being worth all the rest of the Townes and Villages between <i>S. John
de Ulhua</i> and <i>Mexico</i>; I thought it not fit to parallell it with the others in
naming it briefely and passing by it as a Traveller, but rather I judged it convenient,
and beseeming my present History, to record to posterity with one
whole Chapter, the greatnesse of it, and the valour of its inhabitants, from the conquest
of <i>America</i> made by <i>Hernando Cortez</i>. Who being upon his march to <i>Mexico</i>,
and having arrived to <i>Zaclotan</i>, and being informed that the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> were men of
valour, and enemies to <i>Montezuma</i> the Emperour of <i>Mexico</i>, thought it his best policy
to joyne with them against the <i>Mexicans</i>.</p>

<p>Whereupon hee dispatched unto them foure <i>Indians</i> of a Towne called <i>Zempoallan</i>, as
Ambassadours to acquaint them of his coming into those parts, and of his desire to visit
their Towne, not for any harme he intended to them, but rather for their good.
The <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> fearing <i>Cortez</i>, and judging him a friend of <i>Montezuma</i>, because upon
his way to visit him, and having heard of the many costly presents which the Emperour
had sent unto him; they resolved to resist his coming, and to send him no answer
to his ambassage; but tooke the four Messengers which he had sent, and imprisoned
them, minding to sacrifice them unto their Gods as Espies. <i>Cortez</i> seeing the long tarrying
of the Messengers, departed from <i>Zaclotan</i>, without any intelligence from <i>Tlaxcallan</i>.
His camp had not marched much after their departure from that place, but
they came to a great circuit of stone made without lime or morter, being of a fadome
and a halfe high, and twenty foot broad, with loupe holes to shoot at; this wall crossed
over a whole valley, from one mountain to another, and but one only entrance or
gate, in the which the one wall doubled against the other, and the way there was
fourty paces broad, in such sort that it was an evil and perillous passage, if any had
been there to defend it. <i>Cortez</i> demanded the cause of that circuit, and who had built
it; the <i>Indians</i> that went with him, told him that it was but a division from their countrey
and <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, and that their Antecessors had made the same to disturbe the entrance
of the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> in time of warre, who came to rob and murther them because
of the friendship betwixt them and <i>Montezuma</i>, whose vassals they were. That strange
and costly wall seemed a thing of great majesty to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and more superfluous
then profitable, yet they suspected that the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> were valiant warriers, who
had such defence made against them. But <i>Cortez</i> setting all fear aside, with three hundred
Souldiers on a ranke, entred the way in the wall, and proceeded in good order
all the way forwards, carrying the Ordnance ready charged, and he himselfe the Leader
of all his Army, and sometimes he would be halfe a league before them, to discover
and make the way plain. And having gone the space of three leagues from that circuit,
he commanded his Foot-men to make haste, because it was somewhat late, and he with
his Horse-men went to descry the Way forwards, who ascending up a hill, two of the
formost Horse-men met with fifteen <i>Indians</i> armed with swords, and targets, and tuffes
of feathers, which they used to weare in the warres. These fifteen being Spies, when
they saw the Horse-men, began to flie with fear, or else to give advice. But
<i>Cortez</i> approaching with other three Horsemen called to them to stay; which they by
no means would hearken unto; till six more Horse-men ran after them, and overtooke
them. The <i>Indians</i> then joyning all together with determination rather to die then
to yeeld, shewed to the <i>Spaniards</i> signes to stand still. But the Horsemen coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
lay hands on them; they prepared themselves to battel, and fought, defending themselves
for a while. In this fight the <i>Indians</i> slew two of their Horses, and (as the <i>Spaniards</i> do
witnesse) at two blowes they cut off a Horse head, bridle and all. Then came the rest of
the Horsemen, the Army also of the <i>Indians</i> approached, for there were in sight neer five
thousand of them in good order, to succour their fifteen fighting men; but they came
too late for that purpose, for they were all slain by the <i>Spanish</i> fury, because they
would not render themselves in time, and had killed two of their Horses. Yet notwithstanding
their fellowes fought, until they espied the <i>Spanish</i> Army coming, and the
Ordnance, then they returned leaving the field to the <i>Spaniards</i>, whose Horse-men followed
them, and slew about seventy of them, without receiving any hurt. With
this the <i>Indians</i> perceiving the great advantage which the <i>Spaniards</i> had against them
with their Horses, and meaning to come upon them subtilly with a more powerful Army,
that they might the better deceive and delude them, they sent unto <i>Cortez</i> two of the
four Messengers which had been sent unto them with other <i>Indians</i>, saying, that they
of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> knew nothing of the things that had happened, certifying likewise that
those with whom he had fought, were of other communities, and not of their jurisdiction,
being sorrowfull for that which had passed; and for so much as it happened
in their countrey, they would willingly pay for the two Horses which were slain, praying
them to come in good time to their Towne, who would gladly receive them, and
enter into their league of friendship, because they seemed to bee valiant men; But all
this was a feigned and a false message. Yet <i>Cortez</i> beleeved them, and gave them thanks
for their courtesie and good will; and that according to their request he would goe
unto their Towne, and accept their friendship. And touching the death of his Horses,
hee required nothing, for that within short time he expected many more; yet sorrowfull
he was not so much for the want of them, as that the <i>Indians</i> should thinke that
Horses could die or be slain. <i>Cortez</i> proceeded forwards about two leagues, where the
Horses were killed, although it was almost sun set, and his men wearied, having travelled
far that day. He planted his Army by a river side, remaining all that night with good
watch both of Foot-men and Horse-men, fearing some assault; but there was no attempt
given that night. The next morning at sun rising, <i>Cortez</i> departed with his Army
in good order, and in the midst of them went the Fardage and Artillerie, and after
a little marching they met with the other two Messengers whom they had sent from
<i>Zaclotan</i>; they came with pitifull cryes exclaiming of the Captaines of the power of
<i>Tlaxcallan</i>, who had bound them and detained them from returning; but with good
fortune that night they had broken loose, and escaped, for otherwise in the morning
following they had been sacrificed to the God of Victory, and after the sacrifice they
had been eaten for a good beginning of the warres; the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> protesting to
doe the like to the bearded men (for so they termed the <i>Spaniards</i>) and to as many as came
with them. They had no sooner told their tale, when there appeared behind a little hil
about a thousand <i>Indians</i>, very well appointed after their fashion, and came with such a
marvellous noise and cry, as though their voyces should have pierced the heavens; hurling
at the <i>Spaniards</i>, stones, darts, and shot with bowes and arrowes. <i>Cortez</i> made
many tokens of peace unto them, and by his Interpreters desired them to leave
the battail. But so much the more as he intreated for peace, the more hasty and earnest
were they, thinking either to overcome them, or else to hold them play, to the intent
that the <i>Spaniards</i> should follow them to a certaine ambush that was prepared for
them, of more then fourescore thousand men. Here the <i>Spaniards</i> began to cease
from words, and to lay hand upon their weapons; for that company of a thousand were
as many as on the <i>Spaniards</i> side were fighting men; though they were well practised
in the warres, very valiant, and also pitched in a better place for fight. This battail
endured certaine houres, and at the end the <i>Indians</i> being either wearied, or else
meaning to take the <i>Spaniards</i> in the snare appointed, began to flie towards the main
battail, not as overcome, but to joyne with their own side. The <i>Spaniards</i> being hot
in the fight and slaughter, which was not little, followed them with all their fardage,
and unawares fell into the ambush, among an infinite number of <i>Indians</i> armed; they
stayd not, because they would not put themselves out of order, and passed through
their campe with great haste and fear. The <i>Indians</i> began to set upon the <i>Spanish</i> Horse-men,
thinking to have taken their lances from them, their courage was so stout; many
of the <i>Spaniards</i> had there perished, had it not been for their <i>Indian</i> friends, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
had come with them from <i>Zempoallan</i> and <i>Zaclotan</i>. Likewise the courage of <i>Cortez</i>
did much animate them; for although hee led his Army making way, yet divers times
hee turned him back to place his men in order, and to comfort them, and at length
came out of that dangerous way and ambush, where the Horses might help, and the
Ordnance stand instead, which two things did greatly annoy the <i>Indians</i> to their
great wonder and marvell, and at the sight thereof began to flie. In both incounters
remained many <i>Indians</i> slain and wounded, and of the <i>Spaniards</i> some were hurt, but
none killed, who gave most hearty thankes unto God for their delivery from so great
a multitude as were foure score thousand against one thousand onely of <i>Indians</i>
and <i>Spaniards</i> joyned together. The <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zempoallan</i> and <i>Zaclotan</i> did play the valiant
men that day, wherefore <i>Cortez</i> honoured them with hearty thankes. Then they
went to pitch their Campe in a village called <i>Teoacazinco</i>, where was a little Tower and
a Temple, and there fortified themselves. The night following the <i>Spaniards</i> slept not quietly
with fear of a third Invasion of the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>. As soone as it was day <i>Cortez</i> sent to
the Captains of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> to require them of Peace and Friendship, willing them quietly
to suffer them to passe through their Countrey to <i>Mexico</i>, for that they meant them
no hurt, but rather good wil. The answer of the captains of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> was, that the next
day they would come and talke with him and declare their minds. <i>Cortez</i> was well prepared
that night, for the answer liked him not, but rather seemed brave, and a matter
determined to be done, as some had told him (whom hee tooke prisoners) who likewise
certified that the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> were joyned together, to the number of a hundred
and fifty thousand men to give battaile the next day following, and to swallow
up alive the <i>Spaniards</i> whom so mortally they did hate, thinking them to bee friends
unto the Emperour <i>Montezuma</i>, unto whom they wished all evill and mischief. Their
intent was therefore with all their whole power to apprehend the bearded men, and
to make of them a more solemne Sacrifice unto their Gods then at any time they
had done, with a generall banquet of their flesh, which they called <i>Celestiall</i>.</p>

<p>The Captaines of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> divided their Souldiers into foure Battailes, the one to
<i>Tepeticpac</i>, another to <i>Ocotelulco</i>, the third to <i>Tizatlan</i>, and the fourth to <i>Quiahuiztlan</i>,
that is to say, the men of the Mountaines, the men of the Limepits, the men of
the Pinetrees, and the Water men; all these foure sorts of men did make the Body of
the Common-weelth of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, and commanded both in time of War and Peace.
Every of these Captaines had his just portion or number of Warriers, but the Generall
of all the whole Army was called <i>Xicotencatl</i>, who was of the Limepits; and hee had
the Standard of the Common-wealth, which is a Crane of gold with his wings spread,
adorned with Emeralds and Silver worke, which Standard was according to their
use either carryed before the whole Host, or else behind them all. The Lieutenant
Generall of the Army was <i>Maxixcazin</i>; and the number of the whole Army was a
hundred and fifty thousand men. Such a great number they had ready against foure
hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and seven hundred <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zempoallan</i> and <i>Zaclotan</i>, and yet at
length overcome; and after this fight they were the greatest friends that <i>Cortez</i> had in
those parts against <i>Montezuma</i>. These Captaines came with their Companies, that
the fields where they were seemed a Forrest. They were gallant Fellowes and well
Armed according to their use, although they were painted, so that their faces shewed
like Devils, with great tuffes of Feathers, and they boasted gallantly. Their Weapons
and Armour were Slings, Staves, Speares, Swords, Bowes and Arrowes, Sculles,
Splintes, Gantlets, all of Wood, guilt or else covered with Feathers or Leather;
their Corselets were made of Cotton Wooll, their Targets and Bucklers
gallant and strong, made of wood covered with leather and trimmed with latten,
and feathers, their Swords were staves with an edge of flint stone cunningly
joyned into the staffe, which would cut very well and make a sore wound. Their instruments
of War were hunters hornes, and Drummes called <i>Ataballs</i> made like a Caldron
and covered with Vellam. So that the <i>Spaniards</i> in all their discovery of <i>India</i>
did never see a better Army together, nor better ordered; that which I could not omit
to speake of here, having come in the order of my history to <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, where
this numerous and gallant <i>Indian</i> Army was set forth against 400 <i>Spaniards</i> and 600
<i>Indians</i> their friends. These <i>Indians</i> thus ordered in Battail bragged very much against
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and said amongst themselves, What mad people are these bearded
men that threaten us and yet know us not? But if they will bee so bold to invade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
our Countrey without our licence, let us not set upon them so soone, it is meet they
have a little rest, for wee have time enough to take and bind them; let us also send them
meat, for they are come with empty stomackes, and so they shall not say that we do apprehend
them with wearinesse and hunger. Whereupon they sent unto the <i>Spaniards</i>
three hundred Turkey cocks and two hundred baskets of bread, called <i>Centli</i>; the
which present was a great succour and refreshment for the need the <i>Spaniards</i> stood in.
And soone after, Now (say they) let us goe and set upon them, for by this time they
have eaten their meat, and now we will eat them, and so shall they pay us the victuals
that we sent. These &amp; such like brags they used, seeing so few <i>Spaniards</i> before them,
and not knowing the strength of their Ordnance against their so numerous an host.
Then the foure Captaines sent two thousand of their valiantest men of warre, and old
Souldiers, to take the <i>Spaniards</i> quietly, with commandement that if they did resist,
either to binde them, or else to kill them, meaning not to set their whole Army upon
them, saying, that they should get but small honour for so great a multitude to fight against
so few. The two thousand Souldiers passed the trench that was betwixt the two
campes, and came boldly to the Tower where the <i>Spaniards</i> were. Then came forth
the Horse-men, and after them the Foot-men, and at the first encounter, they made
the <i>Indians</i> feele how the iron swords would cut; at the second, they shewed of what
force those few in number were, of whom a little before they had so jested: but at
the third brunt, they made those lusty Souldiers flie, who were come to apprehend
them, for none of them escaped, but only a few such as knew the passage of the trenches
or ditch. Then the main battail and whole Army set forth with a terrible and
marvellous noise, and came so fierce upon the <i>Spaniards</i>, till they entred into their
campe without any resistance, and there were at handy strokes with the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
in a good space could not get them out, many of them being killed, which were so bold
to enter. In this sort they fought four houres, before they could make way among
their enemies. Then the <i>Indians</i> began to faint, seeing so many dead on their side, and
the great wounds they had, and that they could kill none of the Christians; yet the
battail ceased not, till it drew neere night, and then they retired. Whereof <i>Cortez</i>
and his Souldiers were exceeding glad, for they were fully wearied with killing of <i>Indians</i>.
The next day in the morning <i>Cortez</i> went forth to runne the fields as he had done
before, leaving halfe his men to keepe the campe; and because he should not be espied,
he departed before day, and burned about ten Townes, and sacked one Towne, which
was of three thousand houses, in the which were found but few people, because the
most of them were gone to their campe. After the spoile he set fire on the Town, and
came his way to his campe with a great prey by noone time. The <i>Indians</i> pursued
thinking to take away their prey, and followed them into the camp, where they fought
five houres, and could not kill one <i>Spaniard</i>, although many of their side were slain;
for even as they were many, and stood on a throng together, the Ordnance made a
wonderfull spoil among them, so that they left off fighting, and the victory remained
for the <i>Spaniards</i>, whom the <i>Indians</i> thought were inchanted, because their arrowes
could not hurt them. The next day following, the four Captaines sent three severall
things in present to <i>Cortez</i>, and the messengers that brought them said. Sir, behold
here five slaves, and if thou be that rigorous God that eatest mans flesh and blood,
eat these which we bring unto thee, and we will bring thee more. And if thou be
the gentle and meek God, behold here frankincense and feathers. And if thou bee
a mortall man, take here fowle, bread and cherries. <i>Cortez</i> answered that both he and
his were mortall men even as they were. And because that alwaies he had used to tell
them truth, wherefore did they use to tell him lies, and likewise to flatter him, for he
desired to be their friend, advising them not to be mad and stubborn in their opinion,
for if they so did, assuredly they should receive great hurt and dammage.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this answer, there came againe about thirty thousand of them even
to <i>Cortez</i> his campe, to prove their corslets, as they had done the day before, but
they returned with broken pates. Here is to be noted that although the first day the
whole host of <i>Indians</i> came to combat with the <i>Spaniards</i>; yet the next day they did
not so, but every severall Captaine by himselfe, for to divide the better the travaile
and paines equally among them; and because that one should not disturbe another
through the multitude, considering that they should fight but with a few, and in a narrow
place; and for this consideration their battails were more fresh and strong, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
each Captain did contend who should doe most valiantly for to get honour, and especially
in killing one <i>Spaniard</i>, for they thought that all their hurts should be satisfied
with the death of one <i>Spaniard</i>, or taking one Prisoner. Likewise is to be considered
the strangenesse of their battail, for notwithstanding their controversie fifteen daies
that they were there, whether they fought or no, they sent unto the <i>Spaniards</i> cakes
of bread, Turkey cocks and cherries. But this policy was not to give them that meat
for good will, but onely to espie and see what hurt was done amongst them, and also
to see what feare or stomack they had to proceed. But finding by their many spies that
the <i>Spaniards</i> were nothing daunted nor diminished, they resolved to send unto <i>Cortez
Xicotencatl</i>, who was chiefe and generall Captain in <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, and of all the warres;
he brought in his company fifty persons of authority to keep him company. They approached
neer where <i>Cortez</i> was, and saluted each other according to the use of their
countrey. Their salutations ended, and the parties being set downe; <i>Xicotencatl</i> began
the talke, saying. Sir, I am come on mine owne behalfe and also of my fellow Captain
and Lieutenant <i>Maxixca</i>, and in the name of many other noble personages, and
finally in the name of the whole State and Common-wealth of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, to beseech
and pray you to admit us into your friendship, and to yeeld our selves and countrey
unto your King, craving also at your hand pardon for our attempt in taking up armes
against you, wee not knowing what you were, nor what you fought for in our countrey.
And where we presumed to resist and defend your entrance, wee did it as against
strangers whom we knew not, and such men as we had never heretofore seen; and
fearing also that you had been friends to <i>Montezuma</i>, who is, and alwaies hath been
our mortall enemy. And we had rather all in generall to end our lives, then to put
our selves in subjection to him; for we thinke our selves as valiant men in courage as
our fore-fathers were, who alwaies have resisted against him and his grand-father, who
was as mighty as now is he. We would also have withstood you and your force, but we
could not, although we proved all our possibility by night and day, and found your
strength invincible, and we no lucke against you. Therefore since our fate is such, we
had rather be subject unto you then unto any others; for wee have knowne and heard
by the <i>Zempoallanezes</i>, that you doe no evill, nor came not to vexe any, but were most
valiant and happy, as they have seen in the warres, being in your company. For
which consideration, we trust that our liberty shall not be diminished, but rather our
own persons, wives and families better preserved, and our houses and husbandry not
destroyed. And in some of his talke, the tears trickling down his cheeks, he besought
<i>Cortez</i> to weigh that <i>Tlaxcallan</i> did never at any time acknowlege any superiour Lord
or King, nor at any time had come any person among them to command, but only he,
whom now they did voluntarily elect and choose as their Superiour and Ruler. <i>Cortez</i>
much rejoyced with this ambassage, and to see such a mighty Captaine, who commanded
a hundred and fifty thousand Souldiers, come unto his camp to submit himselfe;
judging it also matter of great weight to have that Common-wealth in subjection, for
the enterprise which he had in hand, whereby he fully made an account, that the
wars were at an end, to the great contentation of him and his company, and with
great fame and reputation among the <i>Indians</i>. So with a merry and loving countenance
he answered, laying first to their charge, the hurt and damage which he had received in
their countrey, because they refused at the first to hearken unto him, and quietly to
suffer him to enter into their countrey, as he had required and desired by his messengers
sent unto them from <i>Zaclotan</i>. Yet all this notwithstanding, he did both pardon the
killing of his two Horses, the assaulting of him in the high way, and the lies which
they had most craftily used with him, (for whereas they themselves fought against him,
yet they laid the fault to others) likewise their pretence to murther him in the ambush
prepared for him (enticing him to come to their Towne) without making first defiance
according to the law of Arms. Yet these injuries notwithstanding, he did lovingly
receive their offer made in subjection to the Emperour, and that very shortly he
would be with him in <i>Tlaxcallan</i>. At this same time there were Ambassadours from
<i>Montezuma</i> with <i>Cortez</i>, who grieved much to see the League that was now beginning
between the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i> and the <i>Spaniards</i>; they advised <i>Cortez</i> to give no credit unto
them, saying, they meant nothing but treason, and lies, and to lock them up in
<i>Tlaxcallan. Cortez</i> answered the Ambassadours, that although their advice were
true, yet he did determine to goe thither, for that he feared them lesse in the Towne then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the field. They hearing this answer and determination, besought him to give unto
one of them licence to returne unto <i>Mexico</i>, to advertise <i>Montezuma</i> of all that was past,
with an answer to their ambassage, promising within six dayes to have newes from
<i>Mexico</i>, and till then prayed him not to depart with his campe. <i>Cortez</i> granted their
request, and abode there the time appointed, expecting their answer, and within himselfe
rejoycing to see how the <i>Mexicans</i> began to feare, that his peace with the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>
would be their ruine and destruction, as indeed afterwards it proved. In this
mean season came many of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> to the campe, some brought Turkey cockes, other
brought bread and cherries, with merry countenances, desiring them to goe home
with them unto their houses. The sixt day the <i>Mexican</i> Ambassadour came according to
promise, and brought unto <i>Cortez</i> ten jewels of gold, both rich and well wrought,
and fifteen thousand garments of Cotton exceeding gallant, and most earnestly besought
him on the behalfe of <i>Montezuma</i>, that he should not danger himselfe in trusting to the
words of the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>, who were so poore that with necessity they would rob him
of the things and presents which his Master had sent him, yea and likewise murther
him, knowing of the friendship between his Master and him. At the very same time
all the chiefest Lords of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> came to intreat him to goe with them to <i>Tlaxcallan</i>,
where he should be cherished, lodged and well provided: for it was a great dishonour
and shame unto them to permit such personages to abide in such vile cottages, as they were
in. And if (said they) you trust us not, then we are ready to give you for your
security whatsoever pledges or gages you shall demand. And they did both swear and
faithfully promise that they might safely goe with them, saying also that the Oath
and Faith of their Common-wealth should never be broken for all the goods in the
world. Thus was <i>Cortez</i> on both sides earnestly solicited, and intreated; the <i>Mexicans</i>
fearing his League and friendship with the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>, and these hoping that his
friendship with them would be their chiefe protection against the tyranny of <i>Montezuma</i>.
But <i>Cortez</i> aiming chiefly at the Empire of <i>Mexico</i>, which <i>Montezuma</i> his dissembled
friendship would never helpe him to enjoy; and seeing the good will of so many
gentlemen his new friends of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, the most mortall enemies of <i>Montezuma</i>,
and likewise the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zempoallan</i>, of whom he had good credit, did so importune
him, and assure him of his going, he commanded his Fardage to be laden, and
also his Ordnance, and departed toward <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, with as good order as it had
been to a battail; and at the Tower where he had pitched his camp, he left certain crosses
for a memory with a great heape of stones (which till this day remain in the place,
and my selfe have seen them) and entred into <i>Tlaxcallan</i> the eighteenth of <i>September</i>.
There came out such a multitude of people to see him and to meet him in the way, that
it was a wonder to see. He was lodged in the greatest Temple, which had many
great and fair lodgings sufficient for him and all his company, except the <i>Indians</i> of
<i>Zempoallan</i> and <i>Zaclotan</i> his friends, who were lodged in other Temples. He set certaine
limits, out of the which he commanded straitly that none of his company should
passe upon pain of death, and also commanded that they should take nothing, but
what should be given them. His commandement was well observed, for none presumed
to goe a stones cast without his licence. The <i>Indian</i> gentlemen shewed great pleasure
and curtesie to the strangers, and provided them of all things necessary, and many
of them gave their daughters unto them in token of true friendship, and likewise
to have fruit of their bodies, to be brought up for the wars, being such valiant men.
<i>Cortez</i> being throughly satisfied of their hearty good wills, demanded of them the
estate and riches of <i>Montezuma</i>. They exalted him greatly as men that had proved
his force. And as they affirmed it was neer a hundred yeers, that they maintained
warres with him and his father <i>Axaica</i>, and others his uncles and grand-fathers;
they assured him also that the gold and treasure of <i>Montezuma</i> was without
number, and his power and dominion over all the land, and his people innumerable;
for (said they) he joyneth sometimes two hundred thousand men, yea and three
hundred thousand for one battail. And if it pleased him, he would make as many
men double, and thereof they were good witnesse, because they had many times
fought with them. <i>Cortez</i> told them he was nothing discouraged at all that his power,
but intended a journey to <i>Mexico</i>, not doubting to oppose <i>Montezuma</i>, if hee should
encounter him in the way. He promised them likewise that he would free them from
his tyranny, and subdue in his way all those Townes which were allied to the <i>Mexicans</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and did any way annoy them and their Common-wealth. They gave him
hearty thankes, assuring him to assist him and accompany him to <i>Mexico</i>; and for
the present offered him twenty thousand men, making a solemne League and Covenant
never to forsake him. Thus was <i>Tlaxcallan</i> subdued and sworne to the power
and command of the <i>Spaniards</i>, being in those times one of the chiefest, though
not richest, Townes in <i>America</i>; whose Inhabitants after clave most faithfully to <i>Cortez</i>,
and were chief instruments for the subduing of <i>Mexico</i>; and therefore to this
day are freed from tribute by the Kings of <i>Spain</i>, paying not the money which as a
tribute taxe is layed upon every <i>Indian</i> to bee payed yeerely, but onely in acknowledgement
of subjection they pay yeerely one corne of <i>Maiz</i>, which is their <i>Indian</i>
Wheat. This great Towne of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> is properly in the <i>Indian</i> tongue as
much as to say, as bread well baked, for there is more Graine called <i>Centli</i> gathered, then in
all the Province roundabout. In times past the Towne was called <i>Texcallan</i>, that
is to say, a Valley betwixt two hills. It is planted by a River side, which springeth
out of a hill called <i>Atlancapetec</i>, and watereth the most part of the Province, and from
thence issueth out into the South Sea, by <i>Zacatullan</i>. This Town hath foure goodly
streets, which are called <i>Tepeticpac, Ocotelulco, Tizatlan, Quiahuiztlan</i>. The first
street standeth on high upon a hill, farre from the River which may be about half a
League, and because it standeth on a hill, it is called <i>Tepeticpac</i>, that is to say, a
hill, and was the first population, which was founded there on high because of the
Wars. An other street is situated on the hill side towards the River; because at
the building thereof, there were many Pine trees, they named it <i>Ocotelulco</i>, which
is to say, A pine apple plot. This street was beautifull, and most inhabited
of all the Town, and there was the chiefest Market place, where all the buying and
selling was used, and that place they called <i>Tianquiztli</i>; in that street was the dwelling
house of <i>Maxixca</i>. Along the River side in the plaine standeth another street called
<i>Tizatlan</i>, because there is much Lime and Chalke. In this street dwelled <i>Xicotencatl</i>,
Captaine Generall of the whole Common-wealth. There is another street named
by reason of the brackish water, <i>Quiahuiztlan</i>; but since the <i>Spaniards</i> came thither, all
those buildings are almost altered, after a better fashion, and built with stone. In the
plain by the riverside standeth the Town house, &amp; other Offices, as in the City of <i>Venice</i>.
This <i>Tlaxcallan</i> was governed by Noble and rich men; they used not that one alone
should rule, but did rather flie from that Government as from tyranny, and therefore
hated <i>Montezuma</i> as a tyrant. In their Wars (as I have said before) they had foure
Captaines, which governed each one street, of the which foure they did elect a Captaine
Generall. Also there were other Gentlemen, that were Under-Captaines, but a small
number. In the Wars they used their Standard to bee carried behind the Army, but
when the battaile was to be fought, they placed the Standard, where all the Hoste might
see it, &amp; he that came not incontinent to his Ancient, payed a penalty. Their Standard
had two Crosse-bow Arrowes set thereon, which they esteemed, as the Reliques of their
Ancestours. This Standard two old Souldiers and valiant men, being of the chiefest
Captaines, had the charge to carry, in the which an abuse of soothsaying either
of losse or victory was noted. In this order they shot one of these Arrowes against
the first enemies that they met, and if with that Arrow they did either kill or hurt, it
was a token that they should have the victory, and if it neither did kil nor hurt, then they
assuredly believed that they should lose the field. This Province or Lordship of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>
had 28 Villages and Townes, wherein were contained 150000 housholders.
They are men well made, and were good Warriers, the like were not among the <i>Indians</i>.
They are very poore, and have no other riches, but onely the Graine and
Corne called <i>Centli</i>, and with the gain and profit thereof, they doe both clothe themselves,
and provide all other necessaries. They have many Market places, but the greatest
and most used daily, standeth in the street of <i>Ocotelulco</i>, which formerly was so
famous, that 20000 persons came thither in one day to buy and sell, changing one
thing for another, for they knew not what money meaned. They have now and
had formerly all kind of good policy in the Town; there are Goldsmiths, Feather-dressers,
Barbers, hot houses, and Potters, who make as good earthen Vessel, as is
made in <i>Spain</i>. The earth is fat and fruitfull for Corne, fruit, and pasture, for among
the Pinetrees groweth so much grasse, that the <i>Spaniards</i> feed their Cattell there, which
in <i>Spain</i> they cannot doe. Within two Leagues of the Town standeth a round hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of six miles of heigth, and five and forty miles in compasse, and is now called St. <i>Bartholomewes</i>
hill, where the snow freezeth. In times past they called that hill <i>Matealcucic</i>,
who was their God for water. They had also a God for Wine, who was named
<i>Ometochtli</i>, for the great drunkenesse which they used. Their chiefest God was called
<i>Camaxtlo</i>, and by another name <i>Mixcovatl</i>, whose Temple stood in the street of
<i>Ocotelulco</i>, in the which Temple there was sacrificed some yeeres above eight
hundred persons. In the Towne they speak three languages, that is to say, <i>Nahualh</i>,
which is the courtly speech, and chiefest in all the land of <i>Mexico</i>; another
is called <i>Otomir</i>, which is most commonly used in the Villages; There is one onely
street that speaketh <i>Pinomer</i>, which is the grossest speech. There was also formerly
in the Town a common Jayle, where Felons lay in Irons, and all things which they
held for sinne, were there corrected. At the time that <i>Cortez</i> was there it happened that
a townsman stole from a <i>Spaniard</i> a little gold; whereof <i>Cortez</i> complained to <i>Maxixca</i>,
who incontinent made such enquiry, that the offender was found in <i>Chololla</i>, which
is another great Town five Leagues from thence; they brought the Prisoner with the gold,
and delivered him to <i>Cortez</i>, to doe with him his pleasure. <i>Cortez</i> would not accept
him, but gave him thankes for his diligence; then was hee carried with a cryer before
him, manifesting his offence, and in the Market place upon a Scaffold they
brake his joynts with a cudgell: the <i>Spaniards</i> marvelled to see such strange justice, and
began to bee more confident that as in this point they had endeavoured to pleasure
and right them, so likewise they should afterwards find them very forward to doe
their wills and pleasures for the better conquering of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Montezuma. Ocotelulco</i>
and <i>Tizatlan</i>, are the two streets which now are most inhabited. In <i>Ocotelulco</i>
standeth a Cloister of Franciscan Fryers who are the Preachers of that Town; they
have there joyning to their Cloister a very faire Church, to which belong some fifty
<i>Indians</i> singers, Organists, players on Musicall Instruments, Trumpeters and Waits,
who set out the Masse with a very sweet and harmonious Musick, and delight the fancy
and senses, while the spirit is sad and dull as little acquainted with God, who
will bee worshipped in spirit and in truth. In <i>Tepeticpac</i> and <i>Quiahuiztlan</i> are two
Chappels onely, to which on the Lords Day, and upon other occasions the Fryers of
the Cloister resort to say Masse. In this Cloister wee were entertained a day and two
nights with great Provision of Flesh and Fish, which is very plentifull by reason of
the River; The Fryers are allowed by the Town a dozen <i>Indians</i> who are free from
other Services onely to fish for the Fryers. They change their turnes by Weekes,
foure one Weeke and foure another, except they be called upon for some speciall occasion,
and then they leave all other worke, and attend onely with fish upon the Fryers.
The Town now is inhabited by <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i> together; and is the seat of a
chief Officer of Justice sent from <i>Spain</i> every three yeares, called <i>Alcalde Major</i>,
whose power reacheth to all the Townes within twenty Leagues about. Besides him
the <i>Indians</i> have likewise among themselves, <i>Alcaldes, Regidores</i> and <i>Alguaziles</i>, superiour
and inferiour Officers of Justice appointed yeerely by the <i>Alcalde Major</i>, who
keepes them all in awe, and takes from them for his Service as many as hee pleaseth
without paying any thing for the Service done unto him. The hard usage of this <i>Alcalde
Major</i> and other <i>Spaniards</i> hath much decayed that populous Town, which should
rather have been cherished, then disheartned by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who by meanes of it gained
all the rest of the Country.</p>

<h4><i>Concluding the rest of our journey from</i> Tlaxcallan <i>to</i> Mexico, <i>through the
City of</i> Angels, <i>and</i> Guacocingo.</h4>


<p>The next place most remarkable in the Rode wherein wee travelled was the
City called by the <i>Spaniards, La Puebla de los Angeles</i>, the City of Angels.
To the which wee were desirous to goe, knowing that in it there was a Convent
of Dominicans of our profession, not having met with any such since the
day we departed from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i>. Here wee refreshed our selves at leasure three
dayes, finding our selves very welcome to our owne Brethren, who spared nothing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was fit for our entertainment. Wee visited all the City, and tooke large notice of it,
judging of the wealth and riches of it not only by the great Trading in it, but by the
many Cloisters both of Nuns and Fryers, which it maintaineth, such being commonly
very burthensome to the places where they live, an idle kind of beggers who make
the people believe the maintaining of them is meritorious and saving to their Soules,
and that their prayers for them is more worth then the meanes and sustenance which
they receive from them. Of these there is in that City a very great Cloister of some fifty
or threescore Dominicans, another of more Franciscans, another of Augustins, another
of Mercenarians, another of discalced Carmelites, another of Jesuits, besides foure
of Nuns. This City is seated in a low and pleasant Valley, about ten leagues from a
very high Mountaine, which is alwayes covered with snow; It standeth twenty leagues
from <i>Mexico</i>, it was first built and inhabited in the yeare 1530. by the command of
<i>Don Antonio de Mendoza</i> Viceroy of <i>Mexico</i>, together with the consent of <i>Sebastian
Ramirez</i>, who was a Bishop, and had been President in time past in <i>Sto. Domingo</i>, and
was that yeare in stead of <i>Nunnio de Guzman</i>, (who had behaved himselfe very evill both
with the <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>) sent to bee President of the Chancery of <i>Mexico</i> with
these other foure Judges the Licenciates <i>John de Salmeron, Gasco Quiroga, Francisco Ceynos</i>,
and <i>Alonso Maldonado</i>. These Judges governed the land farre better then <i>Nunnio
de Guzman</i> before them had done; and among other remarkable things they did, was
to cause this City to bee inhabited; and set at liberty the <i>Indians</i> who inhabited there
before, and were grievously suppressed and inslaved by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and therefore
many of them departed from thence, who had inhabited there before, and went to
seeke their living at <i>Xalixco, Honduras, Guatemala</i> and other places, where Warre
then was. This City was formerly called by the <i>Indians Cuetlaxcoapan</i>, that is to
say, a Snake in water; the reason was, because there are two Fountaines, the one of
evill water, and the other of good. This City is now a Bishops Sea, whose yeerely
Revenues since the cutting off from it <i>Xalappa De la Vera Crux</i>, are yet worth above
twenty thousand Duckats; By reason of the good and wholesome aire it dayly
increaseth with Inhabitants, who resort from many other places to live there;
but especially the yeare 1634. when <i>Mexico</i> was like to bee drowned with the inundation
of the lake, thousands left it, and came with all their goods and Families to
this City of the <i>Angels</i>, which now is thought to consist of ten thousand Inhabitants.
That which maketh it most famous is the Cloth which is made in it, and is
sent farre and neere, and judged now to bee as good as the Cloth of <i>Segovia</i>, which
is the best that is made in <i>Spain</i>, but now is not so much esteemed of, nor sent so
much from <i>Spain</i> to <i>America</i> by reason of the abundance of fine Cloth which is made
in this City of <i>Angels</i>. The Felts likewise that are made, are the best of all that Country;
there is likewise a glassehouse, which is there a rarity, none other being as yet
knowne in those parts. But the mint house that is in it, where is coyned halfe the
Silver that cometh from <i>Sacatecas</i>, makes it the second to <i>Mexico</i>; and it is thought
that in time it will bee as great and populous as <i>Mexico</i>. Without it there are many
Gardens, which store the Markets with provision of Salets; the soile abounds with
Wheat, and with Sugar Farmes; among the which not farre from this City there
is one so great and populous (belonging to the Dominican Fryers of <i>Mexico</i>) that for
the work onely belonging unto it, it maintained in my time above two hundred black-more
slaves men and women besides their little children. The chief Town betweene
this City of <i>Angels</i>, and <i>Mexico</i>, is called <i>Guacocingo</i> consisting of some five hundred
<i>Indians</i>, and one hundred <i>Spaniards</i> Inhabitants. Here is likewise a Cloister of Franciscans,
who entertained us gallantly, and made shew unto us of the dexterity of
their <i>Indians</i> in Musick. Those fat Fryers wanted not like the rest all Provision necessary
for the body. But their greatest glory and boasting to us was the education
which they had given to some children of the Town, especially such as served them
in their Cloister, whom they had brought up to dancing after the <i>Spanish</i> fashion at
the sound of the Guitarra. And this a dozen of them (the biggest not being above
fourteene years of age) performed excellently for our better entertainment that night,
wee were there till midnight, singing both <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Indian</i> tunes, capering and
dancing with their Castannettas, or knockers on their fingers with such dexterity, as
not onely did delight, but amaze and astonish us. True it is, wee thought those Franciscans
might have been better imployed at that time in their Quire at their midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
devotions according to their profession; but we still found vowed religious duties
more and more neglected, and worldlinesse too too much imbraced, by such as had
renounced and forsaken the world and all its pleasures, sports and pastimes.</p>

<p>This Towne of <i>Guacocingo</i> is almost as much as <i>Tlaxcallan</i> priviledged by the Kings
of <i>Spain</i>; for that it joyned with <i>Tlaxcallan</i> against the <i>Mexicans</i>, in defence of <i>Hernando
Cortez</i> and the rest of the <i>Spaniards</i> that first conquered that land. These of <i>Guacocingo</i>
being confederated with the inhabitants of <i>Tlaxcallan, Chololla,</i> and <i>Huacacholla</i>
strongly defended the inhabitants of <i>Chalco</i>, when they sent to <i>Cortez</i> for succour, declaring
that the <i>Mexicans</i> made great spoile among them. Which succour <i>Cortez</i> at that
time not being able to send them; being busied in sending for his Vergantines to besiege
<i>Mexico</i> by water as well as by land, he remitted them to the helpe of the <i>Tlaxcalteca's</i>,
and unto these of <i>Guacocingo, Chlolla</i>, and <i>Huacacholla</i>; who shewed great valour
as yet never buried in oblivion, in relieving <i>Chalco</i> against the strength, and power of
<i>Montezuma</i>, which had issued out of <i>Mexico</i>, to keep the <i>Spaniards</i> from drawing
neer unto that City. For that fact is this Towne with the others fore-mentioned, untill
this day priviledged and highly esteemed of the <i>Spaniards</i>. From hence wee made
our last journey to the City of <i>Mexico</i>, parting over the side of that high hill which we
had discovered at the City of <i>Angels</i>, some thirty miles off. There are no Alpes like
unto it for height, cold, and constant snow that lieth upon it. From <i>Spain</i> to that
place we had not felt any such extremity of cold, which made the <i>Spaniards</i> that had
come out of the hot climate of <i>Spain</i>, and endured excessive heat at sea, wonder and
admire. This last journey from <i>Guacocingo</i> to <i>Mexico</i> we reckoned to be thirty <i>English</i>
miles, and of the thirty miles we judged at least the fifteen to be up and downe the hill;
and yet the top of it (whither we ascended not) was far higher. From that highest
part of it which we travailed over, we discovered the City of <i>Mexico</i>, and the lake about
it, which seemed to us to be neer at hand, standing some ten <i>English</i> miles in a
plain from the bottome of this mountaine. When <i>Hernando Cortez</i> went the second
time from <i>Tlaxcallan</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, to besiege it by land and by water, with Vergantines
which for that purpose he had caused to be made, on the side of this mountaine were
his land Forces lodged, where many had perished with cold, had it not been for the
store of wood which they found there. But in the morning he ascended upwards on
this hill, and sent his scout of foure Foot-men and four Horse-men to discover, who
found the way stopped with great trees newly cut downe by the <i>Mexicans</i>, and placed
crossewise in the way. But they thinking that yet forwards it was not so, proceeded
forth as well as they might, till at length the let with great huge Cedars was such, that
they could passe no further, and with this newes were forced to return, certifying <i>Cortez</i>
that the Horse-men could not passe that way in any wise. <i>Cortez</i> demanded of them
whether they had seen any people; they answered No. Whereupon he proceeded forward,
with all the Horse-men, and a thousand Foot-men, commanding all the residue of
his Army to follow him with as much speed as might be; so that with that company
which he carried with him, he made way, taking away the trees that were cut downe to
disturbe his passage; and in this order in short time passed his host without any hurt or
danger, but with great pain and travaile; for certainly if the <i>Mexicans</i> had been there to
defend that passage, the <i>Spaniards</i> had not passed; for it was then a very evill way
(though now it be a reasonable wide open rode, where Mules laden with wares from
<i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, and the Sugar farmes daily passe) and the <i>Mexicans</i> also thought
the same to be sure with the trees which were crossed the way; whereupon they were
carelesse of that place, and attended their coming in plain ground; for from <i>Tlaxcallan</i>
to <i>Mexico</i> are three wayes, of the which <i>Cortez</i> chose the worst, imagining the
thing that afterwards fell out, or else some had advised him how that way was cleare
from the enemies. At the descent of this hill <i>Cortez</i> abode and rested himselfe, till all
the whole Army were come together, to descend downe into the plaine; for from
hence they descried the fires and beacons of their enemies in sundry places, and all
those who had attended their coming by the other two waies, were now gathered together,
thinking to set upon them betwixt certain bridges (which are in the plain made
for travellers by reason of the many dikes and currents of water which issue from the
lake) where a great company abode expecting their coming. But <i>Cortez</i> sent twenty
Horse-men who made way among them, and then followed the whole Army, who
slew many of them without receiving any hurt. Thus did the remembrance of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
antiquities newly refreshed by the object of the hill and plain beneath, make that cold
and hard passage more comfortable and easie unto us. The first Towne we came to below
the hill, was <i>Quahutipec</i>, of the jurisdiction of <i>Tezcuco</i>; where we also called to mind,
that this was the place, neer unto which was pitched the Campe of the <i>Indians</i>
of <i>Culhua</i>, which was neer a hundred thousand men of warre, who were sent by the
Seniors of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Tezcuco</i> to encounter <i>Cortez</i>; but all in vain; for his Horse-men
broke through them, and his Artillerie made such havock among them, that they were
soon put to flight.</p>

<p>Three leagues from hence on our right hand as we travailed, we discovered <i>Tezcuco</i>
by the side of the lake, and out of the Rode; yet it ministred unto us matter of a
large discourse, taken from the time of <i>Cortez</i> and the first Conquerers, who found
it a great City, and at that time even as big as <i>Mexico</i>; though in it <i>Cortez</i> met with
no resistance; for as he journeyed towards it, foure principall persons inhabitants of
it met with his forces, bearing a rod of gold with a little flag in token of peace, saying
that <i>Coacuacoyocin</i> their Lord had sent them to desire him not to make any spoile
in his City, and Townes about it; and likewise to offer his friendship, praying also
that it might please him with his whole Army to take his lodging in the Town of
<i>Tezcuco</i>, where he should be well received. <i>Cortez</i> rejoycing at this message, yet jealous
of some treachery, and mistrusting the people of <i>Tezcuco</i> (whose forces joyned
with the <i>Mexicans</i> and <i>Culhuacans</i> he had met with a little before) went forward on
his way and came to <i>Quahutichan</i> and <i>Huaxuta</i> (which then were suburbs of the great
City <i>Tezcuco</i>, but now are petty Villages by themselves) where he and all his host were
plenteously provided of all things necessary, and threw down the Idols. This done
he entred into the City, where his lodging was prepared in a great house, sufficient
for him and all the <i>Spaniards</i>, with many other his <i>Indian</i> friends. And because that
at his first entry, he saw neither women nor children, he suspected some treason, and
forthwith proclaimed upon pain of death that none of his men should goe out. In
the evening the <i>Spaniards</i> went up into the Zoties and galleries to behold the City, and
there they saw the great number of Citizens that fled from thence with their stuffe, some
towards the mountaines, and others to the water side to take boat, a thing strange
to see the great haste and stirre to provide for themselves. There were at that time at
least twenty thousand little boats (called <i>Canoas</i>) occupied in carrying houshold-stuffe
and passengers; <i>Cortez</i> would faine have remedied it, but the night was so nigh at
hand, that he could not. He would gladly also have apprehended the Lord, but hee
was one of the first that fled unto <i>Mexico</i>. This Towne of <i>Tezcuco</i> to this day is famous
among the <i>Spaniards</i>; for that it was one of the first, if not the first (which according
to the Histories of those parts is very probable) that received a Christian King
to rule and governe. For <i>Cortez</i> hearing that <i>Coacuacoyocin</i> then King of that City and
Townes adjacent was fled, caused many of the Citizens to be called before him, and
having in his company a young gentleman of a Noble house in that countrey, who had
been lately Christened, and had to name <i>Hernando</i> (<i>Cortez</i> being his God-father, who
loved him well) said unto the Citizens, that this new Christian Lord <i>Don Hernando</i>
was sonne unto <i>Nezavalpincintli</i> their loving Lord, wherefore he required them to
make him their King, considering that <i>Coacuacoyocin</i> was fled unto the enemies, laying
also before them his wicked fact in killing of <i>Cacuza</i> his owne brother, onely to
put him from his inheritance and Kingdome, through the enticement of <i>Quahuatimoecin</i>
a mortall enemy to the <i>Spaniards</i>. In this sort was that new Christian <i>Don Hernando</i>
elected King, and the fame thereof being blown abroad, many Citizens repaired home
again to visit their new Prince, so that in short space the City was as well replenished
with people, as it was before, and being also well used at the <i>Spaniards</i> hands, they
served them diligently in all things that they were commanded. And <i>Don Hernando</i>
abode ever after a faithfull friend unto the <i>Spaniards</i> in their warres against <i>Mexico</i>, and
in short time learned the <i>Spanish</i> tongue. And soone after came the inhabitants of
<i>Quahutichan, Huaxuta</i>, and <i>Autenco</i> to submit themselves, craving pardon if in any
thing they had offended. Within two daies after <i>Don Hernando</i> was made King of this
great City and Territorie belonging to it (whose borders reach unto the borders of
<i>Tlaxcallan</i>) came certaine gentlemen of <i>Huaxuta</i> and <i>Quahutichan</i>, to certifie unto him,
how all the power of the <i>Mexicans</i> was coming towards them, and to know if it were
his pleasure, that they should carry their wives, children and other goods into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
mountaines, or else to bring them where he was, their feare was so great. <i>Cortez</i> for
the King his God-child and favourite made unto them this answer, saying, Bee ye
of good courage, and feare ye not. Also I pray you to command your wives and
families to make no alteration, but rather quietly to abide in your houses. And concerning
the enemies I am glad of their coming, for yee shall see how I will deale with
them. But the enemies went not to <i>Huaxuta</i>, as it was thought, neverthelesse <i>Cortez</i>
having intelligence where they were, went out to encounter them with two pieces of
Ordnance, twelve Horsemen and two hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and with many <i>Indians</i> of
<i>Tlaxcallan</i>. He fought with the enemy, and slew but few, for they fled to the water,
and so escaped in their <i>Canoa's</i>. Thus did <i>Cortez</i> in <i>Tezcuco</i> defend himselfe and friends
from the great power of the <i>Mexicans</i>, who daily attempted to be revenged on him,
and the new Christian King whom he had made. But <i>Cortez</i>, thinking that place the
most convenient to lanch his Vergantines to the water, and hearing that they were finished
at <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, sent <i>Gonzalo de Sandoval</i> to bring them from <i>Tlaxcallan</i>; who
at the border of that Province met with them being brought in pieces, as tables, planks
and nayles, with all other furniture, the which eight thousand men carried upon their
backes. There came also for their safe conduct twenty thousand men of warre, and a
thousand <i>Tamemez</i>, who were the Carriers of victuals, and servants. <i>Chichimecatetl</i>,
a principall and valiant <i>Indian</i> and Captaine of a thousand men had the Rere-gard.
And <i>Tupitil</i> and <i>Teutecotl</i>, very principall gentlemen, had the Vant-gard with ten
thousand men. In the midst were placed the <i>Tamemez</i>, and those that carried the
Foyst, with all the apparell of the Vergantines. Before those two Captains went a
hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and eight Horse-men, and behind and last came <i>Gonzalo de Sandoval</i>
with all the residue, and seven Horse-men. Thus they tooke their way towards
<i>Tezcuco</i>, with a marvellous noise, crying, Christians, Christians, <i>Tlaxcallan,
Tlaxcallan</i>, and <i>Spaine</i>. When they came to <i>Tezcuco</i>, they entred in very good
order, with the sound of Drummes, Snail shels, and other like instruments of musick;
and against their entry into the City, they put on all their bravery of clothes, and
bushes of feathers, which was a gallant sight; they were six houres in entring into the
Towne, keeping their array. At the fame of this many Provinces came to submit
and offer their service unto <i>Cortez</i>, some for fear of destruction, and others for the hatred
which they bare to the <i>Mexicans</i>; so that now <i>Cortez</i> was strong both with <i>Spaniards</i>
and <i>Indians</i>; and his Court at <i>Tezcuco</i> was as great, or greater then <i>Montezuma's</i>
formerly had been at <i>Mexico</i>. And here <i>Cortez</i> made his preparation for the siege
of <i>Mexico</i> with all hast, and furnished himselfe with scaling ladders, and other necessaries
fit for such a purpose. His Vergantines being nayled and throughly ended, he made
a sluce, or trench of halfe a league of length, twelve foot broad and more, and two
fadome in depth. This worke was fifty daies a doing, although there were foure
hundred thousand men daily working; truly a famous worke and worthy of memory,
which hath made <i>Tezcuco</i> gloriously mentioned, though now almost decayed in the
great number of inhabitants. The Dock or Trench being thus finished, the Vergantines
were calked with towe and cotton wooll, and for want of Tallow and oyle,
they were (as some Authors report) driven to take mans grease, not that <i>Cortez</i> permitted
them to slay men for that effect, but of those which were slaine in the warres,
and of such as sallied dayly out of <i>Mexico</i> to hinder this work, and fighting were slaine.
The <i>Indians</i>, who were cruel and bloody Butchers, using sacrifice of mans flesh, would in
this sort open the dead body and take out the grease. The Vergantines being lanched,
<i>Cortez</i> mustered his men, and found nine hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, of the which were fourscore
and six Horse-men, and a hundred and eighteen with Crosse-bowes, and Hargabushes;
and all the residue had sundry weapons, as Swords, Daggers, Targets,
Launces, and Halberts. Also they had for armour, Corslets, coats of Mayle, and
Jackes. They had moreover three great Peeces of cast Iron, fifteen small peeces of brasse,
and ten hundred weight of powder, with store of shot, besides a hundred thousand
<i>Indians</i>, men of warre. On Whitsunday all the <i>Spaniards</i> came into the field, that
great plaine below the high mountaine spoken of before, where <i>Cortez</i> made three
chiefe Captaines, among whom he divided his whole Army. Unto <i>Pedro de Alvarado</i>
the first Captaine he appointed thirty Horse-men, and a hundred and seventy
Foote men of the <i>Spaniards</i>, two peeces of Ordnance, and thirty thousand <i>Indians</i>,
commanding him to campe in <i>Tlacopan</i>. Unto <i>Christoval de Olid</i> the second Captaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hee gave three and thirty horsemen, and a hundred and eighteen footmen of the <i>Spanish</i>
Nation, two Peeces of Ordnance and thirty thousand <i>Indians</i>, and appointed him to
pitch his campe in <i>Culhuacan</i>. To <i>Gonzalo de Sandoval</i>, who was the third Captaine,
hee gave three and twenty horsemen, and a hundred and threescore footmen, two
peeces of Ordnance, and forty thousand <i>Indians</i>, with Commission to choose a
place to pitch his campe. In every Vergantine hee planted a peice or Ordnance, six
Hargabushes, or Crosse-bowes, and three and twenty <i>Spaniards</i>, men most fit for that
purpose. Hee appointed also Captaines for each, and himselfe for Generall, whereof
some of the chiefest of his Company began to murmur, that went by land, thinking
that they had been in greater danger; wherefore they required him to goe with the
maine battaile, and not by water. <i>Cortez</i> little esteemed their words; for although
there was more danger in the land then in the water, yet it did more import to have
greater care in the Warres by water, then on the land, because his men had beene in
the one, and not in the other. Besides the chiefest hopes that <i>Cortez</i> had to winne
<i>Mexico</i>, were these Vessels, for with them he burned a great part of the <i>Canoa's</i> of
<i>Mexico</i>, and the rest hee so locked up, that they were no help unto the <i>Mexicans</i>,
and with twelve onely Vergantines hee did annoy his enemy as much by water, as the
rest of his Army did by land. All this preparation for the siege of <i>Mexico</i> by land
and water, with above a hundred thousand <i>Indians</i>, besides the <i>Spaniards</i> above mentioned,
and the twelve Vergantines by water, was finished in this City of <i>Tezcuco</i>,
which is a sufficient argument of the greatnesse of it at that time, maintaining with Provision
fit and necessary so many thousands of people, and it yeelded matter enough
unto us for a large discourse, whilst not farre from the sight of it wee travelled in the open
and direct plaine Rode to <i>Mexico</i>. And as we talked of the greatnesse of it in former
times, so likewise wee now wondered to consider it to bee but a small Government,
where doth constantly reside a <i>Spanish</i> Governour sent from <i>Spain</i>, whose
power reacheth to those borders of <i>Tlaxcallan</i> and <i>Guacocingo</i>, and to most of the petty
Townes and Villages of the plaine, which were formerly under the command and
power of a King; but now are not able to make up above a thousand Duckats a yeer,
which is supposed to bee the yeerly revenues of the Governour; and <i>Tezcuco</i> it self this
day judged to consist onely of a hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, and three hundred <i>Indian</i> Inhabitants,
whose chiefe riches come by gardening, and sending daily in their <i>Canoa's</i>
Herbes and Salets to <i>Mexico</i>. Some wealth likewise they get by their Cedar trees which
grow there, and are ready timber for the buildings of <i>Mexico</i>. Yet now also are these
Cedars much decayed by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who have wasted and spoiled them in their
too too sumptuous buildings. <i>Cortez</i> onely was accused by <i>Pamfilo de Narvaez</i>, for that
hee had spent seven thousand beames of Cedar trees in the worke of his owne house.
Gardens there were in <i>Tezcuco</i> formerly, that had a thousand Cedar trees for walls
and circuite, some of them of a hundred and twenty foot long, and twelve foot in compasse
from end to end; but now that Garden that hath fifty Cedar trees about it, is
much regarded. At the end of this plain wee passed through <i>Mexicalcinco</i>, which
formerly was a great Town, but now not of above an hundred Inhabitants, and from
thence to <i>Guetlavac</i>, a petty Village, yet most pleasant for the shade of many fruit trees,
Gardens, and stately houses which for their recreation some Citizens of <i>Mexico</i> have
built there, being at the foot of the Cawsey which from this Town through the Lake
reacheth about five <i>English</i> miles to <i>Mexico</i>. And thus upon the third day of <i>October</i>,
1625. wee entred into that famous and gallant City, yet not abiding in it, but onely
passing through it, till we came to a house of recreation, standing among the Gardens in
the way to <i>Chapultepec</i>, named Saint <i>Jacintho</i>, belonging to the Dominicans of <i>Manila</i> in
the <i>East-India's</i>, (whither our course was intended) where wee were stately entertained,
and abode till after <i>Candlemasse</i> day, the time of our second shipping at <i>Acoapulco</i> (80
leagues from Manila) by the South-Sea to <i>Manila</i> the chief City of the Islands named
<i>Philippinas</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XII" id="CHAP_XII">CHAP. XII.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing some particulars of the great and famous City of</i> Mexico <i>in former
times, with a true description of it now; and of the State and condition
of it the yeare</i> 1625.</h4>


<p>It hath been no small peece of Policy in the Fryers and Jesuites of <i>Manila</i>
and the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i> to purchase neere about <i>Mexico</i>, some house and
Garden to carry thither such Missionary Preists as they yeerly bring from
<i>Spain</i> for those parts. For were it not that they found some rest and place of
Recreation, but were presently closed up in the Cloisters of <i>Mexico</i> to follow those Religious
duties (which sore against their wills most of them are forced to) they would
soone after a tedious journey from <i>Spain</i> by Sea and land relent of their purposes of
going forward, and venturing upon a second voiage by the South-Sea; and would either
resolve upon a returne to <i>Spain</i>, or of staying in some part of <i>America</i>; as my
selfe and five more of my company did, though secretly and hiddenly, and sore against
the will of Fryer <i>Calvo</i> and others, who had the tutoring and conducting of us.
Therefore that all such as come from <i>Spain</i> to bee shipped againe at <i>Acoapulco</i> for
<i>Philippinas</i>, may have all manner of incouragement, rest and recreations becomming
their Professions, whilst they doe abide in <i>America</i>, and may not bee disheartned by
those that live about <i>Mexico</i>, (who doe truely envy all that passe that way to <i>Asia</i>) the
Fryers and Jesuites have purchased for their Missions houses of Recreation among the
Gardens, which are exempted from the power and command of the Superiors of <i>Mexico</i>,
and are subordinate unto the Government of the Provincials of <i>Philippinas</i>, who
send from thence their substitute Vicars to rule, and to looke to the forementioned houses
and Gardens. To the Dominicans belonged this house called St. <i>Jacintho</i>, whither
wee were carried, and where wee did abide neere five moneths, having all things
provided that were fit and necessary for our Recreations, and for our better encouragement
to a second voiage by Sea. The Gardens belonging to this house might bee of
fifteen Acres of ground, divided into shady walkes under the Orange and Lemmon
trees; there wee had the Pomegranates, Figges, and Grapes in abundance, with the
Plantin, Sapotte, Chicosapotte, Pine-fruit, and all other fruits that were to bee
found in <i>Mexico</i>. The Herbes and Salets, and great number of <i>Spanish Cardoes</i> which
were sold out, brought in a great Rent yeerely; for every day there was a Cart
attended to bee filled and sent to the Market of <i>Mexico</i>; and this not at seasons
of the yeere, as here in <i>England</i> and other parts of <i>Europe</i>, but at all times
and seasons, both Winter and Summer, there being no difference of heat, cold,
frosts, and snow, as with us; but the same temper all the whole yeer, the Winter differing
onely from the Summer by the raine that falls, and not by excessive frosts that nip.
This wee enjoyed without dores; but within wee had all sorts and varieties both of
fish and flesh. What most wee wondred at, was the abundance of sweet-Meats; and
especially of Conserves that were provided for us; for to every one of us during the
time of our abode there, was brought on Munday morning halfe a dozen Boxes of
Conserve of Quinces, and other fruits, besides our Biskets, to stay our stomackes in
the mornings and at other times of the day; for in our stomackes we found a great
difference betweene <i>Spain</i> and that Countrey. For in <i>Spain</i> and other parts of <i>Europe</i>
a mans stomack will hold out from meale to meale, and one meale here of good cheer
will nourish and cherish the stomack foure and twenty houres; But in <i>Mexico</i> and other
parts of <i>America</i> wee found that two or three houres after a good meale of three
or foure severall dishes of Mutton, Veale or Beefe, Kid, Turkies, or other Fowles, our
stomackes would bee ready to faint, and so wee were faine to support them with either
a cup of <i>Chocolatte</i>, or a bit of Conserve or Bisket, which for that purpose was
allowed us in great abundance. This seemed to mee so strange, (whereas the meat
seemed as fat and hearty, excepting the Beefe, as ours in <i>Europe</i>) that I for some satisfaction
presently had recourse to a Doctor of Physick; who cleared my doubt with
this answer, That though the meat we fed on was as faire to looke on, as in <i>Spain</i>;
yet the substance and nourishment in it came farre short of it, by reason of the pasture,
which is dryer and hath not the change of springs which the pastures of <i>Europe</i> have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
but is short and withers soone away. But secondly, hee told mee that the Climate of
those parts had this effect, to produce a faire shew, but little matter or substance. As
in the flesh wee fed on; so likewise in all the fruits there, which are most faire and beautifull
to behold, most sweet and luscious to taste, but little inward virtue or nourishment
at all in them, not halfe that is in a <i>Spanish Camuesa</i>, or <i>English Kentish</i> Pippin.
And as in Meat, and fruit there is this inward and hidden deceit, so likewise the same
is to bee found in the people that are borne and bred there, who make faire outward
shewes, but are inwardly false and hollow hearted. Which I have heard reported much
among the <i>Spaniards</i> to have beene the answer of our Queene <i>Elizabeth</i> of <i>England</i> to
some that presented unto her of the fruits of <i>America</i>, that surely where those fruits grew,
the women were light, and all the people hollow and false hearted. But further reasons I
omit to search into for this; of experience onely I write, which taught me that little substance
&amp; virtue is in the great abundance and variety of food which there is enjoyed, our
stomackes witnessing this truth, which ever and anon were gaping and crying, Feed, feed.
Our Conserves therefore and dainties were plentifully allowed us; and all other incouragements
and no occasion denied us of going to visit <i>Mexico</i>, (which was not
two full miles from us) all the while wee abode there. It was a pleasant walke for us
to goe out in the morning, and to spend all the day in the City and come home at night;
our way lying by Arches made of stone, three miles long to convey the water from
<i>Chapultepec</i> unto the City. Take therefore, gentle Reader, from mee what for the space
of five moneths I could learne concerning it in former and present times. The situation
of this City is much like that of <i>Venice</i>; but onely differs in this, that <i>Venice</i> is
built upon the Sea-water, and <i>Mexico</i> upon a lake, which seeming one, indeed is two;
one part whereof is standing water; the other ebbeth and floweth according to the wind
that bloweth. That part which standeth, is wholesome, good, and sweet, and yeeldeth
store of small fish. That part which ebbeth and floweth, is of saltish, bitter, and pestiferous
water, yeelding no kind of fish, small or great. The sweet water standeth
higher then the other, and falleth into it, and reverteth not backward, as some conceive
it doth. The salt Lake containeth fifteen miles in breadth, and fifteen in length, and
more then five and forty in Circuite; and the Lake of sweet water containeth even as
much; in such sort that the whole Lake containeth much about a hundred miles. The
<i>Spaniards</i> are divided in opinions concerning this water and the springs of it; some
hold that all this water hath but one spring out of a great and high Mountaine which
standeth Southwest within sight of <i>Mexico</i>, and that the cause that the one part of the
Lake is brackish or saltish, is that the bottome or ground is all salt; But however this
opinion bee true or false, certaine it is and by experience I can witnesse that of that part
of the salt water great quantity of Salt is dayly made, and is part of the great Trading
of that City into other parts of the Countrey, nay it is sent part of it to the <i>Philippinas</i>
Islands. Others say that this Lake hath two springs, and that the fresh water springeth
out of that Mountaine which standeth Southwest from <i>Mexico</i>, and the salt brakish
water springeth out of other high Mountaines which stand more Northwest; But
these give no reason for the saltnesse of it, without it bee the agitation of it in the ebbing
and flowing; which not being with tides like the Sea, but with the winds onely
(which indeed make it as stormy sometimes as is the Sea) why may not the winds
produce the same effect in the fresh water Lake? I think rather, if it spring from a
different spring from that from whence springeth the fresh water, the brackishnesse
and saltishnesse of it may proceed from some brackish and sulphurous minerals through
which it passeth in those Mountaines. For by experience I know the like in the Province
of <i>Guatemala</i>, where by a Towne called <i>Amatitlan</i>, there is a standing Lake of
water not altogether sweet and fresh, but a little brackish, which certainly hath its spring
from a fiery Mountaine called there a <i>Vulcan</i>, (whose burning proceeds from the Mines
of brimstone that are within it) from whence spring neere the same Towne likewise
two or three springs of exceeding hot water, which are resorted to for wholesome
bathes, as coming through a sulphurous mine, and yet the standing Lake proceeding
from the same Mountaine is of that quality that it maketh the ground about it salt, and
especially in the mornings the people go to gather up the salt which
lyeth upon the ground by the water side like unto a hoary frost. But thirdly, others concieve that that
part of the Lake of <i>Mexico</i> which is saltish and brackish comes through the earth from
the North Sea; and though springs of water which come from the Sea lose their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
brackishnesse through the earth, yet this may keepe some brackishnesse by reason
of the minerals, which are many in those parts; or by reason of the great, wide and open
concavities of those mountaines, which being very hollow within (as wee find by
experience of the Earthquakes which are more frequent there then here by reason of
the wind that getteth into those concavities, and so shake the earth to get out) give no
way to the water to sweeten through the earth, or to lose all that saltnesse which it
brought with it from the Sea. But whatsoever the true reason bee, there is not the like
Lake knowne of sweet and saltish water, one part breeding fish, the other breeding none
at all. This Lake had formerly some fourescore Townes, some say more, situated round
about it; many of them containing five thousand housholds, and some ten thousand,
yea and <i>Tezcuco</i> (as I have said before) was as bigge as <i>Mexico</i>. But when I was there,
there might bee thirty Townes and Villages about it, and scarce any of above five hundred
housholdes between <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>; such hath beene the hard usage of
the <i>Spaniards</i> towards them, that they have even almost consumed that poore Nation.
Nay two yeers before I came from those parts, which were the yeers of 1635. and 1636.
I was credibly informed that a million of <i>Indians</i> lifes had been lost in an indeavour
of the <i>Spaniards</i> to turne the water of the Lake another way from the City, which was
performed by cutting away through the Mountaines, for to avoid the great inundations
that <i>Mexico</i> was subject unto, and especially for that the yeer 1634. the waters grew
so high that they threatned destruction to all the City, ruinating a great part, and coming
into the Churches that stood in the highest part of it, in so much that the people
used commonly boats and <i>Canoa's</i> from house to house. And most of the <i>Indians</i> that
lived about the Lake were imployed to strive against this strong Element of water,
which hath been the undoing of many poore wretches, but especially of these thirty
Towns and Villages that bordered near upon the Lake; which now by that great work
is further from the houses of the City; and hath a passage made another way, though it
was thought it would not long continue, but would find againe its old course towards
<i>Mexico</i>. This City when <i>Cortez</i> first entred into it, (was as some say) of sixty, but more
probably it is reported to have beene of fourescore thousand houses. <i>Montezuma</i> his
palace was very great, large and beautifull, which in the <i>Indian</i> language was named <i>Tepac</i>;
and that had twenty doores or gates, which had their outcoming into the common
streets. It had three Courts; and in the one stood a faire Fountaine, many hals,
and a hundred chambers of three and twenty, and thirty foot long, an hundred
bathes, and hot houses; and all this without nailes, yet very good workmanship.
The walls were made of Masons worke, and wrought of Marble, Jaspe, and other
black stone, with veines of red, like unto Rubies and other stones which glistered very
faire; the roofs were wrought of timber, and curiously carved, being of Cedar, Cypres,
and Pine tree; the Chambers were painted and hung with cloth of Cotton, and
of Coneys haire and feathers. The beds onely were unseeming this great state, very
poore and of no value, such as to this day the best and richest <i>Indians</i> use; for they
weare nothing but mantles laid upon mattes, or upon hey, or else mattes alone. Within
this Palace lived a thousand women, nay some affirme three thousand, reckoning
gentlewomen, servants and slaves, all together; But the most were principall <i>Indians</i>
daughters; of whom <i>Montezuma</i> tooke for himselfe those that liked him best, and the
others hee gave in marriage to gentlemen his servants. It is credibly reported among
the <i>Spaniards</i> that hee had at one time a hundred and fifty women his wives with
child, who commonly tooke medicines to cast their creatures, because they knew that
they should not inherit the State; and these had many old women to guard them, for
no man was permitted to looke upon them. Besides this <i>Tepac</i>; which signifieth,
Palace, <i>Montezuma</i> had yet in <i>Mexico</i> another house with very curious lodgings and fair
Galleries, built upon pillars of Jaspe, which looked towards a goodly Garden, in
the which there were at least a dozen Ponds, some of salt water for Sea fowles, and others
of fresh water for River fowles and Lake fowles, which Ponds were devised
with Sluces to empty and to fill at pleasure for the cleannesse of the Fowles feathers;
and these Fowles are said to have beene so many in number, that the Ponds could
scarcely hold them, and of such severall sorts, and of such strange and various coloured
feathers, that the most of them the <i>Spaniards</i> knew not, nor had at any time seen the
like. There did belong to that house above three hundred persons of service, who
had their severall charge concerning these Fowles; some had care to cleanse the Ponds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
others were appointed to fish for bait; others served them with meat; and to every kind of
fowle they gave such bait as they were wont to feed of in the fields or rivers; others did
trim their feathers; others had care to look to their egs; others to set them abrood; &amp; the
principallest office was to pluck the feathers; for of them were made rich mantles, tapistry,
targets, tuffes of feathers, and many other things wrought with gold and silver.</p>

<p>Besides this house, <i>Montezuma</i> had yet another house within <i>Mexico</i>, appointed
only for hawking fowles, and fowles of rapine. In which house there were many
high Halls, wherein were kept men, women, and children, such as were dwarfes,
crook-backs or any monstrous persons, and with them such as were born white
of colour, which did very seldome happen; nay some would deform their children
on purpose to have them carried to the Kings house, to helpe to set forth his greatnesse
by their deformity. In the lower Halls of this house there were Cages for fowls
of rapine of all sorts, as Hawkes, Kites, Boyters (which are very many in those
parts) and of the Hawkes neer a dozen sundry kinds of them. This house had for daily
allowance five hundred Turkey cocks, and three hundred men of service, besides the
Falconers and Hunters, which some say were above a thousand men. The Hunters were
maintained in that house, because of the ravenous Beasts which were also kept in the
lower Halls in great cages made of timber, wherein were kept in some Lions, in other
Tygres, in other Ownzes, in other Wolves; in conclusion, there was no four-footed
beast that wanted there, only to the effect, that the mighty <i>Montezuma</i> might say that
he had such things in his house; and all were fed daily with Turkey cocks, Deare,
Dogges, and such like. There were also in another Hall great earthen vessels, some
with earth, and some with water, wherein were Snakes, as grosse as a mans thigh,
Vipers, Crocodiles which they call <i>Caymanes</i>, of twenty foot long with scales and
head like a Dragon; besides many other smaller Lisarts and other venemous beasts and
Serpents, as well of the water as of the land. To these Snakes and the other venemous
beasts they usually gave the blood of men sacrificed to feed them. Others say
they gave unto them mans flesh, which the great Lisarts, or <i>Caimanes</i> eat very well. But
what was wonderfull to behold, horrid to see, hideous to heare in this house, was
the Officers dayly occupations about these Beasts, the floor with blood like a gelly,
stinking like a slaughter-house, and the roaring of the lions, the fearfull hissing of the
Snakes and Adders, the dolefull howling and barking of the Wolves, the sorrowfull
yelling of the Ownzes and Tigres, when they would have meat. And yet in this place,
which in the night season seemed a dungeon of Hell, and a dwelling place of the Devill,
could a heathen Prince pray unto his Gods and idols: for neer to this Hall was another
of a hundred and fifty foot long and thirty foot broad, where was a chappell
with the roofe of silver and gold in leafe wainscotted and decked with great store of
pearl and stone, as Agats, Cornerines, Emeralds, Rubies, and divers other sorts;
and this was the Oratory where <i>Montezuma</i> prayed in the night season, and in that
chappell the Devill did appear unto him, and gave him answer according to his prayers,
which as they were uttered among so many ugly and deformed beasts, and with the
noise of them which represented Hell itselfe, were fitted for a Devils answer. He had
also his Armoury, wherein was great store of all kind of such Ammunition which
they used in their wars, as Bowes, Arrowes, Slings, Launces, Darts, Clubs,
Swords and bucklers, and gallant Targets more trimme then strong, and all made
of wood, gilt or covered with leather. The wood whereof they made their Armour
and Targets was very hard and strong; and at their arrowes ends they inclosed a little
peece of flint-stone, or a peece of a fish-bone called <i>Libisa</i>, which was so venemous,
that if any were hurt with it, and the head remained in the wound, it so festered that
it was almost incurable. Their Swords were of wood, and the edge thereof was
flint-stone, inclosed or joyned into a staffe; and with these swords they cut speares, yea
and a Horses neck at a blow, and could make dents into iron, which seemeth a thing
unpossible and incredible. These flints were joyned into the staffes with a certain kind
of glew, which was made of a root called <i>Zacolt</i>, and <i>Teuxalli</i>, which is a kind of strong
sand, whereof they made a mixture, and after kneaded it with blood of Battes, or
Reare-mice and other fowle, which did glew so strong, that it scarce ever uncleaved
again; and of these <i>Montezuma</i> had in his house of Armour great store. But besides
these houses it is wonderfull to relate, yet many others which that great heathen Emperour
had for his only recreation and pastime, with excellent fair gardens of medicinall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
herbs, sweet flowers, and trees of delectable savour. But of one garden more especially
it is said, that in it there were a thousand personages made, and wrought artificially
of leaves and flowers. And <i>Montezuma</i> would not permit that in this garden
should be any kind of Pot-herbs, or things to be sold, saying that it did not appertain
to Kings to have things of profit among their delights and pleasures, for that
such did appertaine to Merchants. Yet out of <i>Mexico</i> he had Orchards with many
and sundry fruits; and likewise pleasant houses in woods and forrests, of great compasse,
environed with water, in the which he had fountaines, rivers, ponds with fish,
rockes and coverts where were Harts, Bucks, Hares, Foxes, Wolves and such like,
whither he himselfe seldome went; but the Lords of <i>Mexico</i> used to goe to sport
themselves in them. Such and so many were the houses of <i>Montezuma</i>, wherein few
Kings were equall with him. He had dayly attending upon him in his privy guard
six hundred noblemen and gentlemen, and each of them three or foure servants, and
some had twenty servants or more according to their estate; and the most credible report
goes, that in this manner he had three thousand men attendants in his Court, all
which were fed in his house of the meat that came from his table. There were in those
times under the <i>Mexicall</i> empire three thousand Lords of Townes, who had many vassals;
but more especially there were thirty of high estate, who were able to make each
of them a hundred thousand men of warre. And all these noble men did abide in
<i>Mexico</i>, certaine time of the yeare in the Court of <i>Montezuma</i>, and could not depart
from thence without especiall licence of the Emperour, leaving each of them a sonne
or brother behind them for security of rebellion; and for this cause they had generally
houses in the City; such and so great was the Court of <i>Montezuma</i>. Moreover he
spent nothing in the buildings of all these his houses, for he had certayne Townes that
payed no other tribute, but only to work and repair continually his houses at their
own proper cost, and payed all kind of workemen, carrying upon their backes, or
drawing in sleds stone, lyme, timber, water, and all other necessaries for the
worke. Likewise they were bound to provide all the wood that should be spent in the
Court, which was five hundred mens burthens, and some daies in the winter much
more. But especially for the Emperours chimneys they brought the barke of Oke trees,
which was esteemed for the light. Thus was that great City formerly illustrated with
a mighty Monarch, his houses, and attendants. There were then also in <i>Mexico</i> three
sorts of streets, very broad and faire; the one sort was only of water, with many
bridges, another sort of only earth, and the third of earth and water, the one half
being firme ground to walke upon, and the other halfe for boats to bring provision to
the City; the most part of the houses had two doores, the one toward the Cawsey,
and the other toward the water, at the which they tooke boat to goe whither they list.
But this water (though so neer to the houses) being not good to drinke, there is
other water fresh and sweet brought by conduit to <i>Mexico</i>, from a place called <i>Chapultepec</i>
three miles distant from the City, which springeth out of a little hill, at the foot
whereof stood formerly two statues, or images wrought in stone, with their Targets
and Launces, the one of <i>Montezuma</i>, the other of <i>Axaiaca</i> his father. The water is
brought from thence to this day in two pipes built upon Arches of brick and stone like
a fair bridge; and when the one pipe is foule, then all the water is conveyed into the
other, till the first be made cleane. From this fountaine all the whole City is provided,
and the Water-men go selling the same water from street to street, some in little
boats, others with earthen Tankards upon Mules or Asses backs. The chiefe and principall
division of this City when the <i>Spaniards</i> first conquered it, was into two streets,
the one was called <i>Tlatelulco</i>, that is to say, a little Island, and the other <i>Mexico</i>, where
<i>Montezuma</i> his dwelling and Court was, signifying in the language a spring. And because
of the Kings palace there, the whole City was named <i>Mexico</i>. But the old and
first name of the City according to some Histories was <i>Tenuchtitlan</i>, which signifieth
fruit out of a stone, being a compounded name of <i>Tetl</i>, which in the language is stone,
and <i>Nuchtli</i>, which is a sweet fruit called generally in <i>Cuba</i>, and all other parts of <i>America</i>
by the <i>Spaniards, Tunas</i>; the name of the tree whereon this fruit groweth is
called <i>Nopal</i>. And when this City begunne to be founded it was placed neer unto a
great stone that stood in the midst of the lake, at the foot whereof grew one of these
<i>Nopal</i> trees; which is the reason why <i>Mexico</i> giveth for armes and device the foot of a
<i>Nopal</i> tree springing from a stone according to the first name of the City <i>Tenuchtitlan</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
But others do affirme that this City hath the name of the first founder of it, called <i>Tenuch</i>,
the second sonne of <i>Iztacmixcoatl</i>, whose sonnes and descendents did first inhabit
all that part of <i>America</i>, which is now called new <i>Spain. Mexico</i> is as much as to say
a spring or fountain, according to the property of the vowell or speech, from whence
some judge that City to be so named. But others doe affirme that <i>Mexico</i> hath its name
from a more ancient time, whose first founders were called <i>Mexiti</i>, for unto this day
the <i>Indian</i> dwellers in one street of this City are called of <i>Mexica</i>. And that these <i>Mexiti</i>
tooke name of their principall idol called <i>Mexitli</i>, who was in as great veneration as
<i>Vitzilopuchtli</i>, God of the warre. But others affirme (and this opinion is most received
among the <i>Spaniards</i>) that the <i>Mexicans</i> first were the inhabitants of <i>nova Galicia</i>;
from whence they made a violent irruption <i>Anno Domini</i> 720. and lingered in divers
places till the yeare 902. when under the leading of <i>Mexi</i> their chiefe Captaine they
built this City, and called it after the name of their Generall. They were in all seven
Tribes, which ruled long in an Aristocraticall state; till the most puissant of the
Tribes called <i>Navatalcas</i> elected a King to whom they submitted themselves. The
first King that was thus elected, was called <i>Vitzilovitli</i>; the second, <i>Acamopitzli</i>; the
third, <i>Chimalpapoca</i>; the fourth, <i>Izchoalt</i>; the fifth, <i>Montezuma</i> the first; the sixth,
<i>Acacis</i>; the seventh, <i>Axaiaca</i>; the eighth, <i>Antzlol</i>, the ninth, <i>Montezuma</i> the second,
who reigned when <i>Cortez</i> came first; the tenth, was <i>Quahutimoc</i>, who lost <i>Mexico</i>,
and in whom ended that <i>Indian</i> Empire. The most fortunate of these Kings was
<i>Izchoalt</i>, who by his cousin <i>Tlacacllec</i>, subdued the other six Tribes, and brought them
under the <i>Mexican</i> Kings. And after the death of <i>Izchoalt, Tlacacllec</i> was by the first
electours (which were six in number) chosen King, as a man of whose vertue they
had formerly made tryall. But he very nobly refused it, saying that it was more convenient
for the Common-wealth that another should be King, and that he should execute
that which was otherwise more fit for the necessity of the State, then to lay the
whole burthen upon his back; and that without being King, he would not leave to
labour for the publike as well as if he were King. Upon this generous refusall they
made choice of <i>Montezuma</i> the first. The most unhappy Kings of that nation (at
whose birth could not but be some dysastrous aspect of the Planets) were the two last
<i>Montezuma</i> the second, and <i>Quahutimoc</i>, who were both vanquished by <i>Ferdinando Cortez</i>,
who tooke <i>Montezuma</i> prisoner out of his owne palace, and with fair words and
language carried him to his lodging in <i>Mexico</i>; and kept him there, knocking a paire
of gyves on his legges, untill the execution of <i>Qualpopoca</i> Lord of <i>Nabutlan</i>, now
called <i>Almeria</i> (who was to be burnt for killing nine <i>Spaniards</i>) was past. But this
imprisonment of their Emperour stirred up the hearts of all the <i>Mexicans</i> to conspire
against <i>Cortez</i> and the <i>Spaniards</i>, against whom they fought a most fierce and bloody
battaile two or three daies together, crying out for their Emperour, and threatning
them with the cruellest death that ever man suffered. Whereupon <i>Cortez</i> desired <i>Montezuma</i>
to goe up into the Sotie of his house which they were battering with stones, and
to command his subjects to cease from their heat and fury; who at <i>Cortez</i> his request
went up and leaned over the wall to talke with them, and beginning to speake unto
them, they threw so many stones out of the street, houses, and windows, that one
happened to hit <i>Montezuma</i> on the temples of his head, with which blow he fell down
dead to the ground; and this was his end, even at the hands of his owne subjects and
vassals against their wills, in the City of his greatest glory, and in the power and custody
of a forain and strange nation. The <i>Indians</i> affirm that he was of the greatest
blood of all his linage, and the greatest King in estate that ever was in <i>Mexico</i>. And
from hence it may very well be noted, that when Kingdomes doe most flourish, then
are they nighest to a change; or els to change their Lord, as doth appeare in this History
of <i>Montezuma</i>, whose great glory and majesty presaged the downfall of that City
and people; who though after the death of <i>Montezuma</i> they made <i>Quahutimoc</i> their
Emperour, and persisting in their furious battery against <i>Cortez</i> his palace, caused him
and all his <i>Spaniards</i> to flie out of <i>Mexico</i>; yet having strengthened themselves againe
in <i>Tlaxcallan</i>; and prepared sixteen, or as others say, eighteen Vergantines for the lake,
they soone after besieged <i>Mexico</i> so by water and land, that the Citizens were in great
necessity, and so many dead with hunger and sicknesse, that there were heapes of
dead bodies in the houses, only to keep close their extreme misery; who would not
yeeld even when they saw their King <i>Quahutimoc</i> his fair houses burned, and the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
part of their City consumed with fire and beaten downe plaine with the ground, so
long as they could injoy any one street, Tower, or Temple to defend themselves and
oppose the <i>Spaniards</i>; who after many fierce and bloody fights by land and with
their boates by water having wonne the chief Market place and most of the City, as
they went walking in the streets found heapes of dead bodies in the houses, streets,
and in the water, and the very barkes of trees and roots gnawne by the hungry creatures,
and the men so leane and yellow that it was a pitifull sight to behold.
And with this <i>Cortez</i> yet required them to yeeld; but they although they were so
leane of body were strong in heart, and answered that hee should not speak of any
friendship to them, nor yet hope of their spoile, for when no fortune would favour
them, then they would either burne their treasure, or throw it into the Lake,
where they should never profit thereby, and that they would fight while one alone
should remain alive.</p>

<p><i>Cortez</i> desirous to see what remained of the City to win, went up into a high Tower,
and having well viewed the City, hee judged that of eight parts one remained
yet to win. And assailing the same, the sorrowfull Citizens bewailing their unfortunate
fate and destiny, beseeching the <i>Spaniards</i> to make an end, and to kill them all
out of hand; others standing at the brim of the water neere unto a draw-bridge cried
out, Oh Captain <i>Cortez</i>, seeing that thou art the Child of the Sun, why dost thou
not intreat the Sun thy Father to make an end of us? Oh thou Sun that canst goe
round about the World in a day and a night, wee pray thee make an end of us and
take us out of this miserable life, for we desire death to goe and rest with our God <i>Quetcavatlh</i>
who tarrieth for us. <i>Cortez</i> seeing the great extremity that these poor wretched
people were in, thinking now that they would yeeld unto him, sent a message to
<i>Quahutimoc</i>, desiring him to consider his Subjects great extremity, which yet might be
greater if hee yeelded not to Peace. But when the stubborn King heard this ambassage,
hee was so moved with ire and choler, that forthwith hee commanded <i>Cortez</i> his
Ambassadour to bee sacrificed, and gave the rest of the <i>Spaniards</i> that went with him
for answer blowes with stones, staves, and Arrowes, saying that they desired death
and no Peace. Whereupon <i>Cortez</i> seeing the King to stubborn and refractory after so
much slaughter and misery of his subjects, after so many Combates and skirmishes
made with the losse of almost all the City, sent forthwith <i>Sandoval</i> with his Vergantines
one way, and went himself another combating the houses and forts that yet
remained, where hee found small resistance, so that hee might doe what hee pleased.
One would have thought there had not been five thousand left in all the City seeing
the heapes of dead bodies that lay about the streets and in the houses, and yet such was
this last combate, that there were that day slain and taken prisoners forty thousand persons.
The lamentable cry and mourning of the women and children, would have made a
strong heart relent, the stench also of the dead bodies was wonderfull noysome. That
night <i>Cortez</i> purposed to make an end the next day of the Warres; and <i>Quahutimoc</i>
pretended to flie, and for that purpose had enbarked himself in a <i>Canoa</i> of twenty
Oares. When the day appeared, <i>Cortez</i> with his men, and foure Peeces of Ordnance
came to the corner where those that yet remained were shut up as Cattel in a Pound.
Hee gave order to <i>Sandoval</i> and <i>Alvarado</i> what they should doe, which was to be ready
with their Vergantines, and to watch the coming out of the <i>Canoa's</i>, which were
hidden betwixt certaine houses, and especially to have regard unto the Kings person,
and not to hurt him, but to take him alive. Hee commanded the residue of his men
to force the <i>Mexican</i> boates to goe out, and hee himselfe went up into a Tower, inquiring
for the King, where hee found <i>Xihuacoa</i>, Governour and Captaine Generall
of the City, who would in no wise yeeld himself. Then came out of the City a great
multitude of old folkes, men, women and children to take boat. The throng was
so great with hast to enter the <i>Canoa's</i>, that many by that meanes
were drowned in the lake. <i>Cortez</i> required his men not to kill those miserable creatures; But yet hee
could not stay the <i>Indians</i> his friends of <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, and other places, who slew and
sacrificed above fifteen thousand. The men of Warre stood in the housetoppes, and
Zoties beholding their perdition. All the Nobility of <i>Mexico</i> were enbarked with the
King. Then <i>Cortez</i> gave signe with the shot of a hand-Gunne, that his Captaines
should bee in a readinesse, so that in short space they wan fully and wholly the
great City of <i>Mexico</i>. The Vergantines likewise brake in among the Fleet of boates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
without any resistance, and presently beat down <i>Quahutimoc</i> his Royall Standard. <i>Garcia
Holguin</i> who was a Captaine of one of the Vergantines, espied a great <i>Canoa</i> of
twenty Oares deep laden with men, who (being by one of his prisoners informed
that the King was in it) gave chase to it and presently overtooke it. When <i>Quahutimoc</i>,
who stood upon the Puppe of his <i>Canoa</i> ready to fight, saw the <i>Spaniards</i> Crosse-bowes
bent to shoot, and many drawne swords against him, hee yeelded himselfe, declaring
that hee was King. <i>Garcia Holguin</i> being a glad man of such a prisoner tooke
him and carried him unto <i>Cortez</i>, who received him very respectfully. But when
<i>Quahutimoc</i> came neer unto him, hee laid his hand upon <i>Cortez</i> his dagger, saying, I
have done all my best and possible endeavour to defend my self and my Vassals according
to my duty, hoping not to have come to this estate and place where now I stand;
and considering that you may doe with mee what you please, I beseech you to kill
mee, and that is my onely request. <i>Cortez</i> comforted him with faire words, giving
him hope of life; and tooke him up into a <i>Zotie</i>, requiring him to command his
Subjects that yet held out, to yeeld and render themselves. Which <i>Quahutimoc</i> presently
performed; and at that time after so many Prisoners taken, and so many thousands
slain and starved, there were about threescore and ten thousand persons, who
seeing their Prince a Prisoner, threw down their weapons and submitted themselves.
Thus did <i>Hernando Cortez</i> winne the famous and stately City of <i>Mexico</i>, on the 13
day of <i>August, Anno Dom.</i> 1521. In remembrance whereof every yeere on that day
they make in <i>Mexico</i> a sumptuous feast and solemne procession, wherein is carried
the Standard Royall, with the which the City was wonne. In the losse of it was
as much to bee observed as Antiquity can produce of any Victory; wherein was one
Emperour the greatest that ever was in those parts slain; and another as great a Warrier
as ever <i>America</i> had knowne, taken Prisoner. The Siege endured from the time
the Vergantines came from <i>Tlaxcallan</i> three moneths, and therein were on <i>Cortez</i> his
side neer 200000 <i>Indians</i>, who dayly increased and came in to help him, 900 <i>Spaniards</i>;
fourescore horses onely, seventeen or eighteen Peeces of Ordnance; sixteen or as some
say eighteen Vergantines, and at least 6000 <i>Canoa's</i>. In this Siege were slain fifty
<i>Spaniards</i> onely and six horses, and not above eight thousand of the <i>Indians Cortez</i> his
friends. And on the <i>Mexicans</i> side were slaine at least a hundred and twenty thousand
<i>Indians</i>, besides those that died with hanger and Pestilence. At the defence of
the City were all the Nobility, by reason whereof many of them were slaine.
The multitude of people in the City was so great, that they were constrained to eat
little, to drink salt water, and to sleep among the dead bodies, where was a horrible
stench; and for these causes the disease of Pestilence fell among them, and thereof
died an infinite number. Whereupon is to bee considered their valour, and stedfast
determination; for although they were afflicted with such hunger that they were
driven to eat boughes, rindes of trees, and to drink salt water, yet would they not
yeeld themselves. And here also is to be noted that although the <i>Mexicans</i> did eat mans
flesh, yet they did eat none but such as were their enemies; for had they eaten one
another and their owne children, there would not so many have died with hunger.
The <i>Mexican</i> women were highly commended, not onely because they abode with
their husbands and fathers, but also for the great paines they tooke with the sick and
wounded persons; yea and also they laboured in making slings, cutting stones fit
for the same, and throwing stones from the <i>Zoties</i>; for therein they did as much hurt
as their men. The City was yeelded to the spoile, and the <i>Spaniards</i> tooke the
gold, plate and feathers, the <i>Indian</i> friends had all the rest of cloth and other stuffe.
Thus was that famous City ruinated, and burnt by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and the power of
that Nation brought under the <i>Spanish</i> subjection. <i>Cortez</i> having found the aire of
that City very temperate and pleasant for mans life, and the situation commodious,
thought presently of rebuilding it, and of making it the chief Seat of Justice and Court
for all that Country. But before I come to speake of it as rebuilded and now flourishing,
I must adde unto what hath been said of <i>Montezuma</i> his former state and houses
in it, the greatnesse of the Market place and Temple, which was in it, when the <i>Spaniards</i>
ruined and destroyed it. The conveniency of the Lake about this City gave encouragement
to the <i>Mexicans</i> to set apart a most spacious Market place, whither all
the Country about might resort to buy, exchange and sell; which was the more easie
for them by reason of the abundance of Boates which were made onely for such Trafique.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
In this great lake there were at that time above two hundred thousand of these little
boats, which the <i>Indians</i> call <i>Acalles</i>, and the <i>Spaniards</i> call them <i>Canoa's</i>, wrought
like a kneading trough, some bigger then others according to the greatnesse of the
body of the tree, whereof they are made. And where I number two hundred thousand of
these boats, I speak of the least, for <i>Mexico</i> alone had above fifty thousand ordinarily
to carry and bring unto the City victuall, provision, and passengers, so that on the
market-daies all the streets of water were full of them. The Market is called in the
<i>Indian</i> tongue <i>Tlanquiztli</i>; every parish had his Market place to buy and sell in; but
<i>Mexico</i> and <i>Tlatelulco</i> only, which are the chiefest Cities, had great Fayres and places fit
for the same; and especially <i>Mexico</i> had one place, where most dayes in the yeer was
buying and selling; but every fourth day was the great Market ordinarily. This place
was wide and large compassed about with dores, and was so great that a hundred thousand
persons came thither to chop and change, as a City most principall in all that region.
Every occupation and kind of merchandize had his proper place appointed, which
no other might by any means occupie or disturb. Likewise pesterous wares had their
place accordingly, such as stone, timber, lyme, bricke and all such kind of stuffe
unwrought, being necessary to build withall. Also mattes both fine and course, of
sundry workmanship; also coales, wood, and all sorts of earthen vessells, glazed and
painted very curiously. Deere skinnes both raw and tanned in hair and without hair,
of many colours, for Shoemakers, for bucklers, Targets, Jerkins, and lining of
woodden corslets. Also skinnes of other Beasts, and fowle in feathers ready dressed of
all sorts. The colours and strangenesse thereof was a thing to behold. The richest
merchandize was salt, and mantles of Cotton wool of divers colours, both great and
small; some for beds, other for garments and clothing, other for Tapistry to hang
houses; other Cotton-cloth was wont to be sold there for linnen drawers (which to
this day the <i>Indians</i> use) for shirts, tablecloths, towels, and such like things. There
were also mantles made of the leaves of a tree called <i>Metl</i>, and of the Palme-tree and
Conie-hair, which were well esteemed, being very warme, but the coverlets made of
feathers were the best. They sold thred there made of Conie-haire, and also skains
of other thred of all colours. But the great store of poultrey which was brought to
that Market was strange to see, and the uses they sold and bought them for; for although
they did eat the flesh of the fowl, yet the feathers served for clothing, mixing one
sort with another. But the chiefe bravery of that market was the place where gold
and feathers joyntly wrought were sold; for any thing that was in request, was there
lively wrought in gold and feathers and gallant colours. The <i>Indians</i> were so expert
and perfect in this science, that they would work or make a butter-flie, any wild beast,
trees, roses, flowers, hearbs, roots, or any other thing so lively that it was a thing marvellous
to behold. It happened many times that one of these workemen in a whole day
would eat nothing, only to place one feather in his due perfection, turning and tossing
the feather to the light of the sunne, into the shade or darke place to see where was
his most naturall perfection, and till his worke were finished he would neither eat nor
drinke. There are few nations of so much fleame or substance. The art, or science of
Gold-smiths among them was the most curious, and very good workmanship, engraven
with tooles made of flint or in mould. They will cast a platter in mould with eight
corners, and every corner of severall metall, the one of gold, and the other of silver,
without any kind of solder. They will also found or cast a little cauldron with loose
handles hanging thereat, as we use to cast a bell; they will also cast in mould a fish of
metall, with one scale of silver on his back, and another of gold; they will make a
Parret or Popingay of metall, that his tongue shall shake, and his head move, and his
wings flutter; they will cast an Ape in mould, that both hands and feet shall stirre,
and hold a spindle in his hand seeming to spin, yea and an apple in his hand as though
he would eat it. They have skill also of Amell work and to set any pretious stone. But
now as touching the market, there was to sell gold, silver, Copper, Lead, Latten, and
Tinne; although there was but very little of the three last metals mentioned. There
were pearls, pretious stones, divers and sundry sorts of shelles, and bones, Sponges,
and Pedlers ware. There were also many kind of herbes, roots, and seeds, as well
to be eaten, as for medicine; for both men, women and children had great knowledge
in herbs, for through poverty and necessity they did seeke them for their sustenance
and help of their infirmities and diseases. They did spend little among Physitians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
although there were some of that art, and many Apothecaries, who did bring into
the market, oyntments, syrups, waters, and other drugs fit for sick persons. They cure
all diseases almost with herbs; yea as much as for to kill lice they have a proper herb
for the purpose. The severall kinds of meats to bee sold was without number, as Snakes
without head and tail, little dogges gelt, Moules, Rats, Long-wormes, Lyce,
yea and a kind of earth; for at one season in the yeer they had Nets of Mayle, with
the which they raked up a certaine dust that is bred upon the water of the lake of <i>Mexico</i>,
and that is kneaded together like unto oas of the sea. They gathered much of
this and kept it in heapes, and made thereof cakes like unto brick-bats. And they
did not only sell this ware in the Market, but also sent it abroad to other Fayres and
markets afarre off; and they did eat this meal with as good a stomack as we eat cheese;
yea and they hold opinion, that this skumme or fatnesse of the water is the cause that
such great number of fowl cometh to the lake, which in the winter season is infinite.
They sold likewise in this market Venison by quarters or whole, as Does, Hares,
Conies, and Dogges, and many other beasts, which they brought up for the purpose
and tooke in hunting. The great store of sundry kinds of fruits was marvellous,
which were there sold, both green and ripe. There is a sort as bigge as an Almond
called <i>Cacao</i> (whereof is the drinke called <i>Chocolatte</i> well known now in Christendome)
which is both meat and currant money. In these times of the bigger sort sixscore or
sevenscore, and of the lesser sort two hundred are worth a <i>Spanish</i> Riall, which is
sixpence, and with these the <i>Indians</i> buy what they list; for five, nay for two Cacao's
which is a very small part of a Riall, they doe buy fruits and the like. There were divers
kinds of colours to be sold, which they made of roses, flowers, fruits, barks of
trees, and other things very excellent. All the things recited, and many others which
I speak not of, were sold in this great market, and in every other Market of <i>Mexico</i>;
and all the sellers payed a certain summe for their shops or standings to the King,
as a custome, and they were to be preserved and defended from theeves and robbers.
And for that purpose there went Serjeants or Officers up and down the market to espie
out malefactors. In the midst of this Market stood a house, which was to bee seen
throughout the Fayr, and there did sit commonly twelve ancient men for Judges to
dispatch law matters. Their buying and selling was to change one ware for another,
one gave a hen for a bundle of Maiz, others gave mantles for salt or money which was
<i>Cacao</i>. They had measure and strike for all kind of corne, and other earthen measures
for hony and oyle, and such wines as they made of Palme-trees, and other roots and
trees. And if any measure were falsified, they punished the offenders and brake their
measures. This was the civility they had when they were Heathens, for buying and
selling. And although they knew not the true God, but worshipped Idols; yet to
their Idols and to the Divell they dedicated Temples and places of worship, wherein
they used those sacrifices which <i>David</i> speaks of in the 106 <i>Ps.</i> 37 saying, <i>They sacrificed
their sonnes, and their daughters unto Devills.</i></p>

<p>The Temple is called in the <i>Mexican</i> language <i>Teucalli</i>, which is a compound word
of <i>Teutl</i>, which signifieth God, and <i>Calli</i>, which signifieth a house. There were in
<i>Mexico</i> many parish Churches with towers, wherein were Chappels and Altars where
the Images and Idols did stand. All their Temples were of one fashion; the like I beleeve
was never seen nor heard of. And therefore it shall be now sufficient to describe
the chiefe and greatest Temple, which was as their Cathedrall Church. This Temple
was square, and did containe every way as much ground as a Crosse-bow can reach
levell. It was made of stone, with four dores that abutted upon the three Cawseys,
and upon another part of the City that had no Cawsey, but a fair street. In the midst
of this Quadern stood a mount of earth and stone square likewise, and fifty fadome
long every way, built upward like unto a pyramide of <i>Ægypt</i>, saving that the top was
not sharpe, but plain and flat, and ten fadom square. Upon the West side were steps
up to the top, in number a hundred and fourteen, which being so many high and
made of good stone, did seeme a beautifull thing. It was a strange sight to behold the
Preists, some going up, and some downe with ceremonies, or with men to be sacrificed.
Upon the top of this Temple were two great Altars, a good space distant the
one from the other, and so nigh the edge or brimme of the wall, that scarcely a man
might go behind them at pleasure. The one Altar stood on the right hand, and the other
on the left; they were but of five foot high; each of them had the back part made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
stone, painted with monstrous and foul figures. The Chappell was fair and well
wrought of Masons work and timber; every Chappell had three lofts one above another,
sustained upon pillars, and with the height thereof it shewed like unto a faire
tower, and beautified the City afarre off. From thence a man might see all the City
and Towns round about the lake, which was undoubtedly a goodly prospect. And
because <i>Cortez</i> and his company should see the beauty thereof, <i>Montezuma</i> himselfe (to
make the more ostentation of his greatnesse and the Majesty of his Court) carried the
first <i>Spaniards</i> thither, and shewed them all the order of the Temple, even from the foot
to the top. There was a certain plot or space for the Idoll Preists to celebrate their
service without disturbance of any. Their generall prayers were made toward the
rising of the sunne; upon each Altar stood a great Idoll.</p>

<p>Besides this tower which stood upon the Pyramide, there were fourty towers great
and small belonging to other little Temples which stood in the same circuite; the which
although they were of the same making, yet their prospect was not West-ward, but
other waies, because there should be a difference betwixt the great Temple and them.
Some of these Temples were bigger then others, and every one of a severall God; among
the which there was one round Temple dedicated to the God of the ayre called
<i>Quecalcovatl</i>; for even as the ayre goeth round about the heavens, even for that consideration
they made his Temple round. The entrance of that Temple had a dore made
like unto the mouth of a Serpent, and was painted with foule and divellish gestures,
with great teeth and gummes wrought, which was a sight to fear those that should enter
in thereat, and especially the Christians unto whom it represented hell it selfe
with that ugly face and monstrous teeth. There were other Teucallies in the City,
that had the ascending up by steps in three places; and all these Temples had houses by
themselves with all service belonging to them, and Preists, and particular Gods. And
from this manner of these Heathens Temples, and Altars made with steps, wee may
observe how like unto them is now the Church of <i>Rome</i>, which as it confesseth that
there never was a Church without a visible sacrifice, and therefore teacheth that
Christs body must be broken upon their Altars, and distributed not only as a sacrament
to the people, but as a sacrifice in the Preists hands, differing only that the sacrifices of
Sheep and Oxen in the old law, and these of the Heathens were bloody sacrifices, but
theirs of Christs body they call <i>Incruentum Sacrificium</i>, an unbloody sacrifice; so
likewise in the buildings of their Churches with severall Towers and Altars and Chappels
dedicated to severall Saints they seem to have taken from the very Heathens; but
especially in the many steps whereby they ascend up to their Altars, they resemble these,
forgetting Gods words in Exod. 20. 26. saying, <i>Neither shalt thou goe up by steps unto
mine Altar, that thy nakednesse be not discovered thereon</i>. And lastly in their houses and
cloisters joyning to their Churches for the service of them, being full of idolatrous
Preists and Fryers consecrated for their service, they seem likewise to have borrowed
that fancy of Convents, Abbeys, and Priories from the very Heathens, who (as presently
I shall shew) had neer joyning to this great Temple, houses containing thousands
of Preists, with yeerly rents and revenues, like those of <i>Romes</i> Abbeys, and
Cloisters. At every dore of this great Temple of <i>Mexico</i> stood a large hall, and goodly
lodgings both high and low round about, which houses were common Armories for
the City. The Heathens it seems had so much understanding as to know that the force
and strength of a Towne, City, or Countrey is the Temple, and therefore they placed
there their storehouse of munition.</p>

<p>They had other darke houses full of Idols great and small, wrought of sundry metals,
which were all bathed and washed with blood, and did shew very blacke through
their dayly sprinkling and anointing them with the same, when any man was sacrificed;
yea and the walls were an inch thick with blood, and the ground a foot thick
of it, so that there was a divellish stench. The Preists went dayly into those Oratories,
and suffered none other but great personages to enter in. And when any such
went in, they were bound to offer some man to be sacrificed, that those bloudy hangmen
and Ministers of the devill might wash their hands in the blood of those so sacrificed,
and might sprinkle their house therewith. For their service in the Kitchin they
had a pond of water, that was filled once a year, which was brought by the Conduit
pipes before mentioned, from the principall fountaine. All the residue of the fore-said
circuit served for places to breed fowles, with gardens of herbs and sweet trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
with roses and flowers for the Altars; and this is also the Church of <i>Romes</i> custome
and superstition, to trim and deck their Saints and Altars with Garlands and Crowns
of Roses and other flowers. Such, so great and strange was this Temple of <i>Mexico</i>,
for the service of the devill, who had deceived those simple <i>Indians</i>. There did reside
(as I said before of Monkes and Fryers in their Cloisters joyning to their Churches)
in this Temple and houses joyning to it, continually five thousand persons, and all
these were lodged and had their living there; for that Temple was marvellous rich,
and had divers Townes onely for their maintenance, and reparation, and were bound
to sustaine the same alwaies on foot. These Townes did sow corn, and maintain all
those five thousand persons with bread, fruit, flesh, fish, and firewood as much as they
needed, for they spent more firewood then was spent in the Kings Court. These persons
did live like <i>Romes</i> Abby-lubbers at their hearts ease, as servants and vassals unto
the Gods, which were many; and every God had severall rankes and Orders of Preists
to serve him; as the severall Saints canonized by the Popes of <i>Rome</i> have under them
distinct Religious Orders of Preists, Dominick hath Dominicans, Francis Franciscans,
Benedict Benedictines, Basil Basilians, Bernard Bernardines, Augustin Augustines,
and the like.</p>

<p>The Gods of <i>Mexico</i> (as the <i>Indians</i> reported to the first <i>Spaniards</i>) were two
thousand in number; the chiefest were <i>Vitzilopuchtli</i>, and <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>, whose Images
stood highest in the Temple upon the Altars. They were made of stone in full
proportion as bigge as a Gyant. They were covered with a lawne called <i>Nacar</i>; they were
beset with pearles, pretious stones, and peeces of gold, wrought like birds, beasts,
fishes, and flowers, adorned with Emeralds, Turquies, Chalcedons, and other little fine
stones, so that when the lawne was taken away, the Images seemed very beautifull and
glorious to behold. But must I find out <i>Rome</i> still among these heathens? and will
the Papists bee angry if I tell them plainly that what I mislike in these Idolatrous <i>Mexicans</i>,
I mislike in them? for doe not they deck and adorne their Idol Saints, as the
heathens did <i>Vitzilopuchtli</i> and <i>Tezcatlipuca</i>? Doe not they cover their woodden and
stony statues of Saints, and of the Virgin <i>Mary</i> with fine lawne shirts, and hide
them with curtaines of cloth of Gold, and crowne them with Crowns of Silver and
Gold, and enrich them with costly and pretious jewels and Diamonds; not considering
that they are the workes of their owne hands? <i>Ad quid perditio hæc? poterant enim
venundari, &amp; dari pauperibus?</i> These two <i>Indian</i> Idols had for a girdle great snakes
of gold, and for collars or chaines about their necks ten hearts of men made of gold;
and each of them had a counterfeit Visor with eies of glasse, and in their necks Death
painted. These two Gods were brethren, for <i>Tezcatlipuca</i> was the God of Providence,
and <i>Vitzilopuchtli</i>, God of the Warres; who was worshipped and feared more then
all the rest. There was another God, who had a great Image placed upon the top
of the chappell of Idols, and hee was esteemed for a speciall and singular God above
all the rest. This God was made of all kind of seeds that grow in that Countrey,
which being ground, they made a certain paste tempered with childrens blood and Virgins
sacrificed, who were opened with rasors in their brests, and their hearts taken out,
to offer as first fruits unto the Idoll. The Preists consecrated this Idoll with great pompe
and many Ceremonies. All the <i>Comarcans</i> and Citizens were present at the Consecration
with great triumph and incredible devotion. After the Consecration many devout
persons came and sticked in the dowy Image pretious stones, wedges of gold,
and other Jewels. And after all this pompe ended, no secular man might touch that
holy Image; no nor yet come into his Chappel; nay scarcely religious persons,
except they were <i>Tlamacaztli</i>, who were Preists of Order. They did renew this
Image many times with new dough, taking away the old. And then (like againe
unto the Papists who think themselves happy with their Saints reliques, though
ragges or bones) blessed was hee that could get one peece of the old ragges, or a peece
of the old dough, for the which there was most earnest suites made by the Souldiers,
who thought themselves sure therewith in the Warres. Also at the Consecration of
this Idoll, a certaine vessell of water was blessed with many words and ceremonies
(peradventure from this heathenish Ceremonie came the superstitious holy water to
<i>Rome</i>) and that water was preserved very religiously at the foot of the Altar, for to
consecrate the King when hee should bee crowned, and also to blesse any Captaine
Generall, when hee should be elected for the Wars, with onely giving him a draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of that water. And as the <i>Romish</i> Church makes much of their dead mens skulles
and rotten bones, laying them up in their Churchyards under some arches made for
that purpose in the Churchwalls, even so was it here in <i>Mexico</i>; for without this Temple,
and over against the principall doore thereof, a stones cast distant stood a Charnell
house onely of dead mens heads, Prisoners in Warres and sacrificed with the
knife. This monument was made like unto a Theatre, more large then broad, wrought
of lime and stone, with ascending steps; in the walls whereof was graffed betwixt
stone and stone a skull with the teeth outwards. At the foot and head of this Theatre,
were two towers made onely of lime and skulles, the teeth outward, which having
no other stuffe in the wall seemed a strange sight. At and upon the top of the Theatre
were threescore and ten poles, standing the one from the other foure or five foot distant,
and each of them was full of staves from the foot to the top. Each of these
staves had others made fast unto them, and every one of them had five skulles broched
through the temples. When the <i>Spaniards</i> first entred into <i>Mexico</i> as friends before
the death of <i>Montezuma</i> they visited all these monuments; and in what they
have written and transmitted to posterity of that City, it is recorded of one <i>Andrew
de Tapia</i>, and <i>Gonzalo de Umbria</i> that one day they did reckon these skulles, and found a
hundred thirty and six thousand skulles on the poles, staves and steps. The other
Towers were replenished out of number; and there were men appointed, that when
one skull fell, to set up another in his place, so that the number might never want.
But all these Towers and Idols were pulled down, and consumed with fire, when the
<i>Spaniards</i> wanne that City. And certainly they had beene more renowned in destroying
those Altars of the devill and those Idoll Gods, if in their stead they had not
set up new Idols and Saints of stockes and stones, and built unto them as many more
Churches as they found at their comming thither. All therefore that hath been mentioned
hitherto of <i>Montezuma</i> his houses and Gardens, of the spacious Market place,
and Temples of that City was utterly destroyed and brought downe to the very ground.
But <i>Cortez</i> reedified it againe, not onely for the situation and majesty, but
also for the name and great fame thereof. Hee divided it among the Conquerours,
having first taken out places for Churches, Market places, Towne house and other
necessary plots to build houses, profitable for the Common-wealth. Hee separated
the dwellings of the <i>Spaniards</i> from the <i>Indians</i>, so that now the water passeth and
maketh division betwixt them. Hee promised to them that were naturalls of the City
of <i>Mexico</i> plotts to build upon, inheritance, freedome, and other liberties, and the
like unto all those that would come and inhabit there, which was a meanes to allure
many thither. Hee set also at liberty <i>Xihuaco</i>, the Generall Captaine, and made him
chief over the <i>Indians</i> in the City, unto whom hee gave a whole street. He gave likewise
another street to <i>Don Pedro Montezuma</i> who was sonne to <i>Montezuma</i> the King.
All this was done to winne the favour of the people. Hee made other Gentlemen
Seniors of little Islands, and streets to build upon, and to inhabit, and in this order the
whole situation was reparted, and the work began with great joy and diligence.
And when the same was blowne abroad that <i>Mexico</i> should bee built again, it was a
wonder to see the people that resorted thither hearing of liberty and freedome. The
number was so great that in three miles compasse was nothing but people men and women.
They laboured sore and did eate little, by reason whereof many sickned, and
pestilence ensued, whereof died an infinite number. Their paines was great, for
they bare on their backes, and drew after them stones, earth, timber, lyme, brick,
and all other things necessary in this sort; And by little and little <i>Mexico</i> was built
againe with a hundred thousand houses, more strong and better then the old building
was. The <i>Spaniards</i> built their houses after the <i>Spanish</i> fashion; and <i>Cortez</i> built his
house upon the plot where <i>Montezuma</i> his house stood, which renteth now yeerely
foure thousand duckats, and is called now the Palace of the Marques <i>Del Valle</i>,
the King of <i>Spain</i> having conferred upon <i>Cortez</i> and his heires this title from the
great Valley of <i>Guaxaca</i>. This Palace is so stately that (as I have observed before)
seven thousand beames of Cedar Trees were spent in it. They built faire Dockes covered
over with Arches for the Vergantines; which Dockes for a perpetuall memory
doe remaine untill this day. They dammed up the streets of water, where now faire
houses stand, so that <i>Mexico</i> is not as it was wont to bee, and especially since the
yeare 1634. the water cometh not by farre so neere the City as it was wont to come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The Lake sometimes casteth out a vapour of stench, but otherwise it is a wholesome
and temperate dwelling, by reason of the Mountaines that stand round about it,
and well provided through the fertility of the Countrey, and commodity of the Lake.
So that now is <i>Mexico</i> one of the greatest Cities in the World in extention of the
situation for <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Indian</i> houses. Not many yeeres after the Conquest it was
the Noblest City in all <i>India</i> as well in Armes as Policy. There were formerly at the
least two thousand Citizens, that had each of them his horse in his stable with rich
furniture for them, and Armes in readinesse. But now since all the <i>Indians</i> farre and
neer are subdued, and most of them especially about <i>Mexico</i> consumed, and there is
no feare of their rising up any more against the <i>Spaniards</i>, all armes are forgotten,
and the <i>Spaniards</i> live so secure from enemies, that there is neither Gate, Wall, Bulwarke,
Platforme, Tower, Armory, Ammunition, or Ordnance to secure and defend
the City from a Domestick or forraine enemy; from the latter they thinke St. <i>John de
Ulhua</i> sufficient and strong enough to secure them. But for Contractation it is one
of the richest Cities in the World; to the which by the North Sea commeth every
yeer from <i>Spain</i> a Fleet of neere twenty ships laden with the best Commodities not
onely of <i>Spain</i> but of the most parts of Christendome. And by the South Sea it enjoyeth
Traffique from all parts of <i>Peru</i>; and above all it Trades with the <i>East-India's</i>,
and from thence receiveth the Commodities as well from those parts which are inhabited
by <i>Portingals</i>, as from the Countries of <i>Japan</i> and <i>China</i>, sending every
yeere two great <i>Caracas</i> with two smaller Vessels to the Islands of <i>Philippinas</i>, and having
every yeere a returne of such like ships. There is also in <i>Mexico</i> a Mint house
where Money is dayly coyned; and is brought thither in wedges upon Mules from
the Mines called <i>St. Lewis de Sacatecas</i>, standing fourescore Leagues from <i>Mexico</i>
Northward, and yet from <i>Sacatecas</i> forward have the <i>Spaniards</i> entred above a hundred
Leagues conquering daily <i>Indians</i>, where they discover store of Mines; and there
they have built a City, called <i>Nova Mexico</i>, new <i>Mexico</i>. The <i>Indians</i> there are great
Warriers, and hold the <i>Spaniards</i> hard to it. It is thought the <i>Spaniard</i> will not bee
satisfied, untill hee subdue all the Country that way, which doubtlesse reacheth to
our plantations of <i>Virginia</i> and the rest being the same continued continent land. There
is yet more in <i>Mexico</i>, a faire schoole, which now is made an University, which the
Viceroy <i>Don Antonio De Mendoza</i> caused to be built. At the rebuilding of this City
there was a great difference betwixt an Inhabitant of <i>Mexico</i>, and a Conquerour; for
a Conquerour was a name of honour, and had lands and rents given him and to
his posterity by the King of <i>Spain</i>, and the Inhabitant or onely dweller payed rent
for his house. And this hath filled all those parts of <i>America</i> with proud <i>Dons</i> and
Gentlemen to this day; for every one will call himselfe a descendent from a Conquerour,
though hee bee as poore as <i>Job</i>; and aske him what is become of his Estate
and fortune, hee will answer that fortune hath taken it away, which shall never take
away a <i>Don</i> from him. Nay a poore Cobler, or Carrier that runs about the Countrey
farre and neere getting his living with half a dozen Mules, if hee bee called <i>Mendoza</i>,
or <i>Guzman</i>, will sweare that hee descended from those Dukes houses in <i>Spain</i>, and
that his Grandfather came from thence to Conquer, and subdued whole Countries
to the Crowne of <i>Spain</i>, though now fortune have frowned upon him, and covered
his ragges with a thredbare Cloake. When <i>Mexico</i> was rebuilt, and Judges, Aldermen,
Attorneys, Towne Clerks, Notaries, Skavengers, and Serjeants with all other
Officers necessary for the Common-weale of a City were appointed, the fame of
<i>Cortez</i> and majesty of the City was blowne abroad into farre Provinces, by meanes
whereof it was soone replenished with <i>Indians</i> againe, and with <i>Spaniards</i> from
<i>Spain</i>, who soone conquered above foure hundred Leagues of Land, being
all governed by the Princely Seat of <i>Mexico</i>. But since that first rebuilding, I
may say it is now rebuilt the second time by <i>Spaniards</i>, who have consumed most
of the <i>Indians</i>; so that now I will not dare to say there are a hundred thousand houses
which soone after the Conquest were built up, for most of them were of <i>Indians</i>.
Now the <i>Indians</i> that live there, live in the suburbs of the City, and their situation
is called <i>Guadalupe</i>. In the yeare 1625. when I went to those parts, this Suburbe
was judged to containe five thousand Inhabitans; But since most of them have beene
consumed by the <i>Spaniards</i> hard usage and the worke of the Lake. So that now there
may not bee above two thousand Inhabitants of meere <i>Indians</i>, and a thousand of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as they call there <i>Mestizos</i>, who are of a mixt nature of <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>, for
many poore <i>Spaniards</i> marry with <i>Indian</i> women, and others that marry them not
but hate their husbands, find many trickes to convey away an innocent <i>Uriah</i> to enjoy
his <i>Bathsheba</i>. The <i>Spaniards</i> daily cousen them of the small plot of ground where
their houses stand, and of three or foure houses of <i>Indians</i> build up one good and fair
house after the <i>Spanish</i> fashion with Gardens and Orchards. And so is almost all <i>Mexico</i>
new built with very faire and spatious houses with Gardens of recreation. Their
buildings are with stone, and brick very strong, but not high, by reason of the many
Earth-quakes, which would indanger their houses if they were above three stories
high. The streets are very broad, in the narrowest of them three Coaches may goe,
and in the broader six may goe in the breadth of them, which makes the City seeme a
great deale bigger then it is. In my time it was thought to bee of betweene thirty
and forty thousand Inhabitants <i>Spaniards</i>, who are so proud and rich, that half the
City was judged to keepe Coaches, for it was a most credible report that in <i>Mexico</i> in
my time there were above fifteen thousand Coaches. It is a by-word that at <i>Mexico</i>
there are foure things faire, that is to say, the women, the apparell, the horses, and
the streets. But to this I may adde the beauty of some of the Coaches of the gentry,
which doe exceed in cost the best of the Court of <i>Madrid</i> and other parts of Christendome;
for there they spare no Silver, nor Gold, nor pretious stones, nor Cloath of
Gold, nor the best Silkes from <i>China</i> to enrich them. And to the gallantry of their
horses the pride of some doth adde the cost of bridles, and shooes of silver. The
streets of Christendome must not compare with those in breadth and cleannesse, but
especially in the riches of the shops which doe adorn them. Above all the Goldsmiths
shops and workes are to bee admired. The <i>Indians</i>, and the people of <i>China</i> that have
been made Christians and every yeere come thither, have perfected the <i>Spaniards</i> in
that Trade. The Viceroy that went thither the yeere 1625. caused a <i>Popingay</i> to bee
made of silver, gold, and pretious stones with the perfect colours of the <i>Popingays</i>
feathers, (a bird bigger then a pheasant) with such exquisite art and perfection, to present
unto the King of <i>Spain</i>, that it was prized to bee worth in riches and workmanship
halfe a Million of Duckats. There is in the Cloister of the Dominicans a lampe
hanging in the Church with three hundred branches wrought in silver to hold so many
Candles, besides a hundred little lampes for oyle set in it, every one being made with
severall workmanship so exquisitely, that it is valued to be worth four hundred thousand
duckats; and with such like curious workes are many streets made more rich and beautifull
from the shops of Goldsmiths. To the by-word touching the beauty of the women
I must adde the liberty they enjoy for gaming, which is such that the day and night
is to short for them to end a Primera when once it is begun; nay gaming is so common
to them that they invite gentlemen to their houses for no other end. To my self it
happened that passing along the streets in company with a Fryer that came with me that
yeare from <i>Spain</i>, a gentlewoman of great birth knowing us to be <i>Chapetons</i> (so they call
the first yeer those that come from <i>Spain</i>) from her window called unto us, and after
two or three slight questions concerning <i>Spain</i> asked us if wee would come in and
play with her a Game at Primera. Both men and women are excessive in their apparell,
using more silkes then stuffes and cloth; pretious Stones and Pearles further
much this their vaine ostentation; a hat-band and rose made of Diamonds in a Gentlemans
hat is common, and a hat-band of Pearles is ordinary in a Tradesman; nay
a Blackmore or Tauny young maide and slave will make hard shift but shee will bee
in fashion with her Neckchaine and Bracelets of Pearls, and her Eare-bobs of some
considerable Jewels. The attire of this baser sort of people of Blackmores and Mulatta's
(which are of a mixt nature, of <i>Spaniards</i> and Blackmores) is so light, and their
carriage so enticing, that many <i>Spaniards</i> even of the better sort (who are too too
prone to Venery) disdaine their Wives for them. Their cloathing is a Petticoate, of
Silk or Cloth, with many silver or golden Laces, with a very broad double Ribband
of some light colour with long silver or golden Tags hanging down before, the whole
length of their Peticoat to the ground, and the like behind; their Wascoats made like
bodies, with skirts, laced likewise with gold or silver, without sleeves, and a girdle
about their body of great price stuck with Pearls and knots of Gold, (if they bee any
waies well esteemed of) their sleeves are broad and open at the end, of <i>Holland</i> or fine
<i>China</i> linen, wrought some with coloured silks, some with silke and gold, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with silk and silver, hanging downe almost unto the ground; the locks of their heads
are covered with some wrought quoife, &amp; over it another of net work of silk bound with
a fair silk, or silver or golden ribband which crosseth the upper part of their forehead,
and hath commonly worked out in letters some light and foolish love posie; their bare
black and tauny breasts are covered with bobs hanging from their chaines of pearls.
And when they goe abroad they use a white mantle of lawne or cambricke rounded
with a broad lace, which some put over their heads, the breadth reaching only
to their middle behind, that their girdle and ribbands may be seen, and the two ends
before reaching to the ground almost; others cast their mantles only upon their shoulders,
and swaggerers like, cast the one end over the left shoulder, that they may the
better jog the right arme, and shew their broad sleeve as they walke along; others instead
of this mantle use some rich silke petticoat, to hang upon their left shoulder, while
with their right arm they support the lower part of it, more like roaring boyes then honest
civil maids. Their shooes are high &amp; of many soles, the outside whereof of the prophaner
sort are plated with a list of silver, which is fastned with small nailes of broad
silver heads. Most of these are or have been slaves, though love have set them loose at
liberty, to inslave souls to sinne and Satan. And there are so many of this kind
both men and women growne to a height of pride and vanity, that many times the
<i>Spaniards</i> have feared they would rise up and mutiny against them. And for the loosnesse
of their lives, and publike scandals committed by them and the better sort of
the <i>Spaniards</i>, I have heard them say often who have professed more religion and feare
of God, they verily thought God would destroy that City, and give up the Countrey
into the power of some other nation.</p>

<p>I will not relate particulars of their obscene and scandalous, yea and publike carriages,
which would offend my Readers patience, and make his eares to tingle; only I
say, certainly God is offended with that second <i>Sodom</i>, whose inhabitants though
now they be like the green bay-tree flourishing with jewels, pearles, gold, silver, and all
worldly pleasures; <i>They shall soone be cut downe like the grasse and wither as the green herbe,
Ps.</i> 37. 2. And though their great Master and Cardinall <i>Bellarmine</i> make outward
happinesse and flourishing a marke and note of a true Church and Congregation of
Gods people: and of my selfe I could say with <i>David</i> in the 73. <i>Ps.</i> 2,
3. when I lived blindly amongst them, <i>My feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipt; for I was
envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked</i>; yet now being enlightned
in a more sure and certaine truth, I will conclude of them, as <i>David</i> of the flourishing
wicked men of his time in the same Chapter the 16, 17, 18. <i>v. When I thought to know
this, it was too painfull for mee, untill I went into the Sanctuary of God, then understood I
their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou callest them downe to destruction.</i>
And I doubt not but the flourishing of <i>Mexico</i> in coaches, horses, streets, women,
and apparell is very slippery, and will make those proud inhabitants slip and fall into
the power and dominion of some other Prince of this world, and hereafter in the
world to come, into the powerfull hands of an angry Judge, who is the King of Kings
and Lord of Lords, which <i>Paul</i> saith <i>Heb.</i> 10. 31. <i>is a fearfull</i> thing. For this City
doth not only flourish in the waies aforesaid, but also in their superstitious worshiping
of God and Saints, they exceed <i>Rome</i> it selfe, and all other places of Christendome. And
it is a thing which I have very much and carefully observed in all my travailes both in
<i>Europe</i> and in <i>America</i>, that in those Cities wherein there is most lewd licentiousnesse
of life, there is also most cost in the Temples, and most publike superstitious worshipping
of God and of the Saints.</p>

<p>It seems that religion teacheth that all wickednesse is allowable, so the Churches and
Clergy flourish; nay while the purse is open to lasciviousnesse, if it be likewise opened to
enrich the temple walls and roofes, this is better then any their holy water to wash
away the filth of the other. <i>Rome</i> is held to be the head of superstition; and what
stately Churches, Chappels, and Cloisters are in it? what fastings, what processions,
what appearances of devotion? and on the other side, what liberty, what profanenesse,
what whoredomes, nay what sinnes of <i>Sodom</i> are committed in it? In so
much that it could be the saying of a Fryer to my selfe while I was in it, that he verily
thought there was no one City in the world wherein were more Atheists then in <i>Rome</i>.
I might shew this truth in <i>Madrid, Sevill, Valladolid</i>, and other famous Cities in
<i>Spaine</i>, and in <i>Italy</i>, in <i>Millan, Genoa</i> and <i>Naples</i>, relating many instances of scandalls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
committed in those places, and yet the Temples mightily enriched by such who have
thought those alms a sufficient warrant to free them from hell &amp; Purgatory. But I must
return to <i>Mexico</i> which is <i>mille testes</i> of this truth, sin and wickednesse abounding in it;
and yet no such people in the world toward the Church and Clergy, who in their life
time strive to exceed one another in their gifts to the Cloisters of Nuns and Friers,
some erecting Altars to their best devoted Saints, worth many thousand thousand duckats,
others presenting crowns of gold to the pictures of <i>Mary</i>, others lamps, others golden
chains, others building Cloisters at their own charge, others repairing them, others
at their death leaving to them two or three thousand duckats for an annuall stipend. Among
these great Benefactors to the Churches of that City I should wrong my History
if I should forget one that lived in my time, called <i>Alonso Cuellar</i>, who was reported to
have a Closet in his house laid with bars of gold in stead of bricks; though indeed it was
not so, but only reported for his abundant riches and store of bars of gold which he
had in one chest standing in a closet distant from another, where he had a chest full
of wedges of silver. This man alone built a Nunery of Franciscan Nuns, which stood
him in above thirty thousand duckats, and left unto it for the maintainance of the
Nuns two thousand duckats yeerly, with obligation of some masses to be said in the
Church every yeer for his soule after his decease. And yet this mans life was so scandalous,
that commonly in the night with two servants he would round the City, visiting
such scandalous persons whose attire before hath been described, carrying his
beads in his hands, and at every house letting fall a beade and tying a false knot, that
when he came home in the morning towards breake of the day he might number by
his beades the uncivil stations he had walked and visited that night. But these his works
of darkenesse came to light, and were published farre and neer for what happened unto
him whilst I was in <i>Mexico</i>; for one night meeting at one of his stations with a gentleman
that was jealous of him, swords on both sides were drawne, the Concubine
first was stabbed by the Gentleman who was better manned and attended; and <i>Cuellar</i>
(who was but a Merchant) was mortally wounded and left for dead, though afterwards
he recovered. Great Almes and liberality towards religious houses in that City
commonly are coupled with great and scandalous wickednesse. They wallow
in the bed of riches and wealth, and make their Almes the Coverlet to cover their loose and
lascivious lives. From hence are the Churches so fairly built and adorned. There are
not above fifty Churches and Chappels, Cloisters and Nunneries, and Parish Churches
in that City; but those that are there are the fairest that ever my eyes beheld, the
roofes and beams being in many of them all daubed with gold, and many Altars with
sundry marble pillars, and others with Brasil wood staies standing one above another
with Tabernacles for several Saints richly wrought with golden colours, so that twenty
thousand duckats is a common price of many of them. These cause admiration
in the common sort of people, and admiration brings on daily adoration in them to
those glorious spectacles and images of Saints; so Satan shewes Christ all the glory of
the Kingdomes to intice him to admiration, and then <i>All these things will I give thee if
thou wilt fall downe and worship mee</i>, Mat. 4. 8, 9. The devill will give all the world to
be adored.</p>

<p>Besides these beautifull buildings, the inward riches belonging to the Altars are infinite
in price and value, such as Copes, Canopies, hangings, Altar cloths, Candlestickes,
Jewels belonging to the Saints, and crownes of gold and silver, and Tabernacles
of gold and Crystall to carry about their sacrament in Procession, all which would
mount to the worth of a reasonable mine of silver, and would be a rich prey for any
nation that could make better use of wealth and riches. I will not speake much of the
lives of the Fryers and Nuns of that City, but only that there they enjoy more liberty
then in the parts of <i>Europe</i> (where yet they have too much) and that surely the
scandal committed by them doe cry up to heaven for vengeance, judgement, and destruction.</p>

<p>In my time in the Cloister of the Mercenarian Fryers which is entituled for the Redemption
of Captives, there chanced to be an election of a Provinciall to rule over
them, to the which all the Priors and heads of the Cloisters about the countrey had
resorted, and such was their various and factious difference, that upon the suddain all
the Convent was in an uproare, their canonicall election was turned to mutiny and
strife, knives were drawn, many wounded, the scandall and danger of murther so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
great, that the Viceroy was same to interpose his authority and to sit amongst them
and guard the Cloister untill their Provinciall was elected. It is ordinary for
the Fryers to visit their devoted Nuns, and to spend whole daies with them, hearing their
musicke, feeding on their sweet meats, and for this purpose they have many chambers
which they call <i>Loquutorios</i>, to talke in, with wooden bars between the Nuns and
them, and in these chambers are tables for the Friers to dine at; and while they dine,
the Nuns recreate them with their voices. Gentlemen and Citizens give their daughters
to be brought up in these Nunneries, where they are taught to make all sorts of
conserves and preserves, all sorts of needle worke, all sorts of musicke, which is so
exquisite in that City, that I dare be bold to say, that the people are drawne to their
Churches more for the delight of the musick, then for any delight in the service of
God. More, they teach these young children to act like players, and to entice the
people to their Churches make these children to act short dialogues in their Quires,
richly attiring them with mens and womens apparell, especially upon Midsummer day,
and the eight daies before their Christmas, which is so gallantly performed, that many
factious strifes, and single combates have been, and some were in my time, for defending
which of these Nunneries most excelled in musick, and in the training up of
children. No delights are wanting in that City abroad in the world, nor in their
Churches, which should be the house of God, and the soules, not the senses delight.</p>

<p>The chiefe place in the City is the Market place, which though it be not as spacious
as in <i>Montezuma</i> his time, yet is at this day very faire and wide, built all with Arches
on the one side where people may walke dry in time of raine, and there are shops
of Merchants furnished with all sorts of stuffes and silkes, and before them sit women
selling all manner of fruits and herbes; over against these shops and Arches is the
Viceroy his palace, which taketh up almost the whole length of the market with the
walls of the house and of the gardens belonging to it. At the end of the Viceroy his
palace, is the chiefe prison which is strong of stone worke. Next to this is the beautifull
street called <i>la plateria</i>, or Gold-smiths street, where a mans eyes may behold in
lesse then an houre many millions worth of gold, silver, pearles and jewells. The
street of <i>St. Austin</i> is rich and comely, where live all that trade in silkes; but one of the
longest and broadest streets is the street called <i>Tacuba</i>, where almost all the shops are of
Ironmongers, and of such as deale in brasse and steel, which is joyning to those Arches
whereon the water is conveyed into the City, and is so called for that it is the way
out of the City to a Towne called <i>Tacuba</i>; and this street is mentioned farre and neer,
not so much for the length and breadth of it, as for a small commodity of needles
which are made there, and for proofe are the best of all those parts. For stately buildings
the street called <i>del Aquila</i>, the street of the eagle, exceeds the rest, where live Gentlemen,
and Courtiers, and Judges belonging to the Chancery, and is the palace of
the Marquesse <i>del Valle</i> from the line of <i>Ferdinando Cortez</i>; this street is so called from
an old Idoll an Eagle of stone which from the conquest lieth in a corner of that street,
and is twice as big as <i>London</i> stone. The gallants of this City shew themselves daily
some on Horse-back, and most in Coaches about four of the clock in the afternoone in
a pleasant shady field, called <i>la Alameda</i>, full of trees and walkes, somewhat like
unto our More-fields, where doe meet as constantly as the Merchants upon our Exchange
about two thousand Coaches, full of Gallants, Ladies, and Citizens, to see
and to be seen, to court and to be courted, the Gentlemen having their train of black-more
slaves some a dozen, some halfe a dozen waiting on them, in brave and gallant
Liveries, heavy with gold and silver lace, with silke stockins on their black legs, and roses
on their feet, and swords by their sides; the Ladies also carry their traine by their
coaches side of such jet-like Damosells as before have been mentioned for their light apparell,
who with their bravery and white mantles over them seem to be, as the <i>Spaniard</i>
saith, <i>mosca en leche</i>, a flie in milke. But the train of the Viceroy who often goeth to this
place is wonderfull stately, which some say is as great as the train of his Master the King
of <i>Spaine</i>. At this meeting are carried about many sorts of sweet-meats and papers of
comfites to be sold, for to relish a cup of coole water, which is cried about in curious
glasses, to coole the blood of those love hot gallants. But many times these their meetings
sweetned with conserves and comfits have sowre sawce at the end, for jealousie
will not suffer a Lady to be courted, no nor sometimes to be spoken to, but puts fury
into the violent hand to draw a sword or dagger and to stab or murther whom he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
jealous of, and when one sword is drawne thousands are presently drawne, some to
right the party wounded or murthered; others to defend the party murthering, whose
friends will not permit him to bee apprehended, but will guard him with drawn swords
untill they have conveyed him to the Sanctuary of some Church, from whence the
Viceroy his power is not able to take him for a legall tryall.</p>

<p>Many of these suddain skirmishes happened whilest I lived about <i>Mexico</i>; of which City
a whole volume might bee compiled, but that by other Authors much hath beene
written, and I desire not to fill my History with trifles, but onely with what is most
remarkable in it. I may not omit yet from the situation of it upon a lake to tell that
certainly the water hath its passage under all the streets of it; for toward the street of
St. <i>Austin</i> and the lower parts of the City, I can confidently averre that in my time
before the removing of the Lake those that died were rather drowned then buried, for
a grave could not bee digged with an ordinary graves depth, but they met with water,
and I was eye-witnesse of many thus buried, whose coffins was covered with water.
And this is so apparent that had not the Cloister of the <i>Augustines</i> often been repaired
and almost rebuilt, it had quite sunk by this. In my time it was a repairing, and
I saw the old pillars had sunk very low; upon the which they were then laying new
foundations, and I was credibly informed that that was the third time that new pillars
had been erected upon the old which were quite sunk away. This City hath but
three wayes to come unto it by Cawsey; the one is from the West, and that Cawsey is a
mile and a halfe long. Another from the North, and containeth three miles in length.
Eastward the City hath no entry; but Southward the Cawsey is five miles long, which
was the way that <i>Cortez</i> entred into it, when hee conquered it.</p>

<p>The fruit called <i>Nuchtli</i> (whereof I have spoken before, and some say this City
was called <i>Tenuchtitlan</i> from it) though it bee in most parts of <i>America</i>, yea and now
in <i>Spain</i>, yet in no place there is more abundance of it then in <i>Mexico</i>, and it is absolutely
one of the best fruits in it. It is like unto the Figge, and so hath many little kernels
or grains within, but they are somewhat larger, and crowned like unto a Medler.
There are of them of sundry colours, some are green without, and carnation-like within,
which have a good taste. Others are yellow, and others white, and some speckled;
the best sort are the white; It is a fruit that will last long. Some of them taste
of Pears, and other some of Grapes; It is a cold and a fresh fruit and best esteemed in
the heat of summer. The <i>Spaniards</i> doe more esteem them then the <i>Indians</i>. The
more the ground is laboured where they grow, the fruit is so much the better. There
is yet another kind of this fruit red, and that is nothing so much esteemed, although
his taste is not evill; but because it doth colour and dye the eaters mouth, lips and
apparell, yea and maketh the Urine looke like pure blood. Many <i>Spaniards</i> at their
first comming into <i>India</i>, and eating this fruit, were amazed and at their wits end,
thinking that all the blood in their bodies came out in Urine; yea and many Physitians
at their first comming were of the same belief. And it hath happened when they
have been sent for unto such as have eaten this fruit, they not knowing the cause, and
beholding the Urine, by and by they have administred medicines to staunch blood; a
thing to laugh at, to see Physitians so deceived. The skinne of the outside is thick
and full of little small prickles, and when it is cut downeright with one cut to the
kernels, with one finger you may uncleave the whole skin roundabout without breaking
it, &amp; take out the fruit to eat. The <i>Spaniards</i> use to jest with it with strangers, taking
half a dozen of them, and rubbing them in a napkin, those smal prickles which can scarce
bee seen or perceived stick invisibly unto the napkin, wherewith a man wiping his
mouth to drink, those little prickles stick in his lips so that they seeme to sow them up
together, and make him for a while faulter in his speech, till with much rubbing and
washing they come off. There is another fruit twice of the bignesse of a great warden,
which they call the growing <i>Manjar Blanco</i>, or white meat, which is a dainty dish
made by them with the white of a Capon, Cream, and Rice, and sugar and sweet waters,
much like unto the which tasteth this fruit. It is as sweet as any hony, and dissolves
like melted snow in the mouth into a juyce most luscious; within, it is full of hard black
kernels or stones, which being cracked are bitter, and these not joyned together, but
by division one from another, each one having a bag, or little skin discerning them
in their rankes and orders, so that when you cut this fruit in the middle it represents a
Chequer board with black and whit; the white is suckt or eaten and the kernels thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
away. But I cannot forget that which they call <i>Pinia</i>, or Pine apple; not the Pine apple of
the high Pine tree, but a pine apple, that groweth upon a lower shrub with prickly leaves,
and is bigger then our biggest Muskmillians in <i>England</i>, when it is ripe; it is yellow without
and within; without it is full of little bunches, and within so juycy and cool that
nothing more dangerous then to eat much of it. Before they eat it, they cut it in round
slices, and lay it a while in salt and water, and so being scoured half an houre in that salt
and water which taketh much of the rawnes and coldnes from it, and then putting into
dishes with more fresh water they eat it thus. But the better way of eating it, is preserved;
which is absolutely the best preserve in all that Countrey. There is also the
Grape, (though they make not wine of it) the Apple, the Peare, the Quince, the Peach,
the Apricock, the Pomegranate, the Muskmillian, the Plantin, the Figge, the Walnut,
the Chesnut, the Orange, the Lemmon both sowre and sweet, the Citron in great abundance.
Most of the fruitts of <i>Europe</i>, and as many more which <i>Europe</i> never knew. About
<i>Mexico</i> more then in any other part groweth that excellent tree called <i>Metl</i>,
which they plant and dresse as they doe their Vines in <i>Europe</i>. It hath neere forty
kindes of leaves, which serve for many uses; for when they bee tender they make of
them Conserves, Paper, Flax, Mantles, Mats, Shooes, girdles, and cordage. On these
leaves grow certaine prickles so strong and sharpe that they use them in stead of sawes:
from the root of this tree cometh a juyce like unto syrup, which being sodde will become
Sugar. You may also make of it Wine and Vineger. The <i>Indians</i> often become
drunke with it. The rind rolled healeth hurts and sores, and from the top boughs
issueth a gumme, which is an excellent antidote against poyson. There is nothing in
<i>Mexico</i> and about it wanting which may make a City happy; and certainly had those
that have so much extolled with their pens the parts of <i>Granada</i> in <i>Spain, Lombardy</i>
and <i>Florence</i> in <i>Italy</i>, making them the earthly Paradise, had they beene acquainted
with the new World and with <i>Mexico</i>, they would have recanted their untruths.</p>

<p>Oh that the Lord were truely worshiped where hee hath powred forth the treasures
of his goodnesse for the children of men! Oh that in that <i>Eden</i> the tempting
and entising Serpent were not so much obeyed in the use of the faire seeming Apple of pleasures,
and the Lord that hath enriched it with such varieties so much neglected! How
long O Lord God, how long shall the line of the wicked flourish, and the best portion
be fallen to Idolaters and to the workers of iniquity?</p>

<p>This City is the seat of an Archbishop, and of a Viceroy, who commonly is
some great Noble man of <i>Spain</i>, whose power is to make Lawes and Ordinances,
to give directions, and determine controversies, unlesse it bee in such great causes,
which are thought fit to bee referred to the Councell of <i>Spain</i>. And though there
bee about the Country many governments with severall Governours, yet they are
all subordinate to this Viceroy, and there are at least foure hundred leagues of land
all governed by the Princely seat of <i>Mexico</i>. Most of the Governours about the Country
being the Viceroy his Creatures, placed by him, doe contribute great gifts and
bribes for their preferment; so likewise doe all the rest whose right or wrong proceedings
depend upon the Viceroy his clemency and mercy in judging the daily appeales of
Justice which come unto him. The King of <i>Spain</i> allowes him out of his Exchequer
yeerly a hundred thousand Duckats whilest hee governes; his time being but
five yeers. But commonly with their bribes to the Courtiers of <i>Spain</i>, and to the
Counsellours for the Estate of the <i>India's</i> they get a prorogation of five yeeres more,
and sometimes of ten. It is incredible to think what this Viceroy may get a yeer in
that place besides his hundred thousand duckats of rent, if hee bee a man covetous
and given to trading, (as most of them are) for then they will bee Masters of what
commodities they please, and none else shall deale in them but themselves; as did the
Marquesse of <i>Serralvo</i> in my time, who was the best Monopolist of salt that ever those
parts knew. This man was thought to get a Million a yeer, what with gifts and presents,
what with his Trading to <i>Spain</i> and <i>Philippinas</i>. He governed ten yeares, and in this
time he sent to the King of <i>Spain</i> a <i>Popingay</i> worth half a Million, and in one year more
he sent the worth of a Million to the Count of <i>Olivares</i>, and other Courtiers to obtain
a prorogation for five yeers more. Besides the Viceroy there are commonly six Judges
and a Kings Attorney, who are allowed out of the Kings Exchequer yeerly twelve
thousand duckats a peice rent, besides two <i>Alcaldes de Corte</i> or high Justices, who with
the Viceroy judge all Chancery and criminall causes. But these, though united together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
they may oppose the Viceroy in any unlawfull and unjustifiable action, as some
have done and have smarted for it, yet commonly they dare not. So that hee doth
what he listeth, and it is enough for him to say, <i>stat pro ratione voluntas</i>. This power
joyned with covetousnesse in the Viceroy, and threescore thousand duckats yeerly,
joyned with pride in the Arch-bishop, was like to be the ruine of that City in the yeer
1624. Then was the Count of <i>Gelves</i> Viceroy, and <i>Don Alonso de Zerna</i> Archbishop,
whose two powers striving and striking at one another like two flints, had almost
brought to combustion that gallant City, and did set on fire the Viceroy his palace,
and the prison joyning to it.</p>

<p>The story was thus, which may be profitable for other nations, to beware of covetous
governours, and proud Prelates; and therefore I thought fit to insert it here.
The Count of <i>Gelves</i> was in some things one of the best Viceroys and Governours that
ever the Court of <i>Spaine</i> sent to <i>America</i>, for he was called by the <i>Spaniards, el terrible
Justiciero, y fuego de Ladrones</i>, that is, terrible for Justice, and fire to consume all theeves.
For he cleered all the high waies of theeves, hanging them as often as they were caught
without mercy, and did send out troopes and officers to apprehend them, so that it
was generally reported that since the conquest unto those dayes of his there had never
been so many theeves and malefactors hanged up as in his time. So in all other points
of justice he was severe and upright. But yet covetousnesse did so blind him to see his
owne injustice, that before he could see it, he had brought the City of <i>Mexico</i> and
the whole Kingdome to a danger of rebellion. What he would not to be seen in himselfe,
he acted by others his instruments. And one of them was one <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>,
a mighty rich Gentleman of <i>Mexico</i>, whom hee chose to joyne with him in monopolizing
all the <i>Indian</i> Maiz, and wheat about the Countrey. <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> of the <i>Indians</i>
bought at the price he list their Maiz, and the wheat of the <i>Spaniards</i> he bought it according
to that price at which it is taxed by the law of that land to be sold at in time of famine;
which is at fourteen Rials a bushell, (which is not much there considering the abundance
of gold and silver) at which price the Farmers and husbandmen knowing
it to be a plentiful yeer were glad and willing to sel unto him their wheat, not knowing
what the end would be, &amp; others fearing to gainsay him, whom they knew to be the Viceroyes
favorite. Thus <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> filled all his barnes which he had hired about the
Countrey, and himselfe and the Viceroy became owners of all the wheat. He had his officers
appointed to bring it into the Markets upon his warning, and that was when some
smal remnants that had escaped his fingers were sold, and the price raised. Then hoised he
his price, and doubled it above what it had cost him. The poore began to complaine,
the rich to murmure, the taxe of the law was moved in the Court of Chancery before
the Viceroy. But he being privy to the Monopoly expounded the law to bee understood
in time of famine, and that he was informed, that it was as plentifull a yeer as
ever had been, and that to his knowledge there was as much brought into the Markets
as ever had been, and plenty enough for <i>Mexico</i> and all the Countrey. Thus was
the law slighted, the rich mocked, the poore oppressed, and none sold wheat but <i>Don Pedro
Mexia</i> his officers for himselfe and the Viceroy. When Justice would be no father,
the people go to their mother the Church; &amp; having understood the businesse better, and
that it was <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>, who did tyrannnize and oppresse them with the Viceroy
his favour, they intreat the Archbishop to make it a case of Conscience, and to reduce
it to a Church censure. <i>Don Alonso de Zerna</i> the Archbishop, who had alwaies stomacked
<i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> and the Viceroy, to please the people, granted to them to excommunicate
<i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>, and so sent out bils of excommunication to be fixed upon
all the Church dores against <i>Don Pedro</i>; who not regarding the excommunication, and
keeping close at home, and still selling his wheat, raising higher the price then it was
before; the Arch-bishop raised this censure higher against him, adding to it a Bill of
<i>Cessatio à divinis</i>, that is, a cessation from all divine service. This Censure is so great
with them, that it is never used but for some great mans sake, who is contumacious
and stubborn in his waies, contemning the power of the Church. Then are all the
Church dores shut up, (let the City be never so great) no masses are said, no prayers
used, no preaching permitted, no meetings allowed for any publike devotion or calling
upon God. Their Church mournes as it were, and makes no shew of spirituall
joy and comfort, nor of any communion of prayers one with another, so long as the
partie continues stubborn and rebellious in his sinne, and scandall, and in yeelding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the Churches censure. And further whereas by this cessation <i>à divinis</i>, many Churches
and especially Cloisters suffer in the means of their livelyhood, who live upon
what is daily given them for the Masses they say, and in a Cloister where thirty or
fourty Preists say Masse, so many peices of Eight or crowns in <i>Mexico</i> doe daily come
in; therefore this censure or <i>cessatio à divinis</i> is so inflicted upon the whole Church
(all suffering for it as they say in spirituall, and some in temporall waies) that the party
offending or scandalizing, for whose sake this curse is laid upon all, is bound to
satisfie all Preists and Cloisters which in the way aforesaid suffer, and to allow them so
much out of his meanes, as they might have daily got by selling away their Masses
for so many crownes for their daily livelyhood. To this would the Arch-bishop have
brought <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>, to have emptied out of his purse neer a thousand crownes
daily, towards the maintenance of about a thousand Preists (so many there may bee in
<i>Mexico</i>) who from the Altar sell away their bread-God to satisfie with bread and food
their hungry stomackes. And secondly by the peoples suffering in their spirituall comfort,
and non-communion of prayers and idolatrous worship, hee thought to make
<i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> odious to the people. <i>Don Pedro</i> perceiving the spightfull intents of
the Archbishop, and hearing the outcries of the people in the streets against him, and
their cries for the use and liberty of their Churches, secretly retired himselfe to the Palace
of the Viceroy, begging his favour and protection, for whose sake he suffered.
The Viceroy immediately sent out his Orders, commanding the bills of excommunication
and cessation <i>à divinis</i> to bee pulled from the Church dores, and to all the Superiors
of the Cloisters to set open their Churches, and to celebrate their service and masses
as formerly they had done. But they disobeying the Viceroy through blind obedience
to their Archbishop, the Viceroy commanded the Arch-prelate to revoke his censures.
But his answer was that what he had done, had been justly done against a publike
offender and great oppressor of the poore, whose cries had moved him to commiserate
their suffering condition, and that the offenders contempt of his first excommunication
had deserved the rigour of the second censure; neither of the which hee
would or could revoke untill <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> had submitted himselfe to the Church
and to a publike absolution, and had satisfied the Preists and Cloisters who suffered
for him, and had disclaimed that unlawfull and unconscionable Monopolie, wherewith
he wronged the whole common-wealth, and especially the poorer sort therein.</p>

<p>Thus did that proud Prelate arrogantly in termes exalt himselfe against the the authority
of his Prince and Ruler, contemning his command with a flat deniall, thinking
himself happy in imitating <i>Ambrose</i> his spirit against the Emperour <i>Theodosius</i>, trusting
in the power of his keyes, and in the strength of his Church and Clergy, which
with the rebellion of the meaner sort he resolved to oppose against the power and
strength of his Magistrate. The Viceroy not brooking this sawcy answer from a
Preist, commanded him presently to be apprehended and to be guarded to <i>St. John de
Ulhua</i>, and there to be shipped for <i>Spaine</i>. The Archbishop having notice of this the
Viceroy his resolution, retired himselfe out of <i>Mexico</i> to <i>Guadalupe</i> with many of his
Preists and Prebends, leaving a bill of excommunication upon the Church dores against
the Viceroy himself, and thinking privily to flie to <i>Spain</i> there to give an account
of his carriage and behaviour. But he could not flie so fast, but the Viceroy his care and
vigilancy still eyed him, and with his Serjeants and Officers pursued him to <i>Guadalupe</i>.
Which the Archbishop understanding, he betook himself to the sanctuary of the church,
and there caused the candles to be lighted upon the Altar, the sacrament of his Bread-God
to be taken out of the Tabernacle, and attiring himselfe with his Pontificall vestiments,
with his Mitre on his head, his Crozier in one hand, in the other he took his
God of bread, and thus with his traine of Preists about him at the Altar, he waited
for the coming of the Serjeants and Officers, whom he thought with his God in his
hand, and with a Here I am, to astonish and amaze, and to make them as Christ the
Jewes in the garden, to fall backwards, and to disable them from laying hands upon
him. The Officers coming into the Church went towards the Altar where the Bishop
stood, and kneeling downe first to worship their God made a short prayer; which being
ended, they propounded unto the Bishop with courteous and faire words the cause
of their coming to that place, requiring him to lay downe the Sacrament; and to
come out of the Church, and to heare the notification of what orders they brought
unto him in the Kings name. To whom the Archbishop replied, that whereas their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Master the Viceroy was excommunicated he looked upon him as one out of the pale of
the Church, and one without any power, or authority to command him in the house
of God, and so required them as they tendered the good of their soules to depart peaceably,
and not to infringe the priviledges and immunity of the Church, by exercising in
it any legall act of secular power and command; and that he would not goe out of the
Church, unlesse they durst take him and the Sacrament together. With this the head
officer named <i>Tiroll</i>, stood up and notified unto him an order in the Kings name to apprehend
his person in what place soever he should find him, and to guard him to the
Port of <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, and there to deliver him to whom by further order he
should be directed there, to be shipped for <i>Spain</i> as a Traitour to the Kings crowne, a
troubler of the common peace, an author and mover of sedition in the Common-wealth.
The Arch-bishop smiling upon <i>Tiroll</i> answered him, Thy Master useth too
high termes; and words which doe better agree unto himselfe; for I know no mutiny
or sedition like to trouble the Common-wealth, unlesse it bee by his and <i>Don Pedro
Mexia</i> his oppressing of the poore. And as for thy guarding mee to <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>,
I conjure thee by Jesus Christ whom thou knowest I hold in my hands, not to use
here any violence in Gods house, from whose Altar I am resolved not to depart; take
heed God punish thee not as he did <i>Jeroboam</i> for stretching forth his hand at the Altar
against the Prophet; let his withered hand remind thee of thy duty. But <i>Tiroll</i> suffered
him not to squander away the time and ravell it out with further preaching, but
called to the Altar a Preist whom he had brought for that purpose, and commanded him
in the Kings name to take the Sacrament out of the Arch-bishops hand; which the
Preist doing, the Arch-bishop unvested himselfe of his Pontificals, and (though with
many repetitions of the Churches immunity) yeelded himselfe unto <i>Tiroll</i>, and taking
his leave of all his Prebends, requiring them to bee witnesses of what had been
done, he went Prisoner to <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, where he was delivered to the custody
of the Governour of the Castle, and not many daies after was sent in a ship prepared
for that purpose to <i>Spaine</i> to the King and Councell, with a full charge of all his
carriages and misdemeanours. Some of the City of <i>Mexico</i> in private began to talke
strangely against the Viceroy, and to stomacke the banishment of their Arch-bishop,
because he had stood out against so high a power in defence of the poore and oppressed,
and these their private grudges they soone vented in publike with bold and arrogant
speeches against <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>, and the Viceroy, being set on and incouraged by
the Preists and Prebends, who it seems had sworne blind obedience to their Arch-Prelate,
and therewith thought they could dispence with their consciences in their obedience
and duty to their Magistrate. Thus did those Incendiaries for a fortnight together
blow the fire of sedition and rebellion, especially amongst the inferiour sort of people
and the Criolians or native <i>Spaniards</i>, and the <i>Indians</i> and Mulatto's, whom they knew
brooked not the severe and rigorous justice and judgement of the Viceroy, no nor any
Government that was appointed over them from <i>Spaine</i>; untill at the fortnights end,
<i>Tiroll</i> returned from <i>St. John de Ulhua</i>, and then began the spite and malice of all the
malecontents to breake out, then began a fire of mutiny to be kindled, which was
thought would have consumed and buried in ashes that great and famous City. <i>Tiroll</i>
was not a little jealous of what mischiefe the common rabble intended against him, and
so kept close, not daring to walke the streets; yet his occasions inviting him to the Viceroy
his palace, ventured himselfe in a Coach with drawne curtaines, which yet could
not blind the eyes of the spightfull and malicious male-contents, who had notice that
he was in the Coach, and before he could get to the market place, three or four boyes
began to cry out, <i>Judas, Judas, alla va Judas</i>, there goeth <i>Judas</i> that laid his hands
upon Christs Vicar; others joyned with them saying, <i>aborquemos a este Judas</i>, let us
hang up this <i>Judas</i>; the number of boyes yet increased, crying aloud and boldly after
the Coach, <i>Muera el Vellaco descomulgado la muerte de Judas, muera el picaro,
muera el perro</i>, let this excommunicated rogue and dog die the death of <i>Judas</i>;
the Coach-man lashed the mules, the Coach posted, the boyes hasted after with stones
and dirt, the number increased so that before <i>Tiroll</i> could get through two streets only,
there were risen above two hundred boyes, of <i>Spaniards, Indians, Black-mores</i>, and
Mulatto's. With much adoe <i>Tiroll</i> got to the Viceroy his Palace, posting for his
life, and his first care was to wish the Porters to shut all the Palace gates: for he was
fearfull of what presently happened, of a more generall insurrection and uproar. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
no sooner was hee got into the Viceroy his house, and the gates shut up, but there were
gathered to the Market place (as I was credibly informed by those that saw and observed
diligently that daies trouble) above two thousand people, all of inferiour rank
and quality; and yet the number still increased till they were judged to bee about six
or seven thousand. They all cried out for <i>Tiroll</i> the <i>Judas</i>, sparing neither stones nor dirt
which they did fling at the Palace windowes.</p>

<p>The Viceroy sent a message to them desiring them to be quiet, and to betake themselves
to their houses, certifying them that <i>Tiroll</i> was not in his Palace, but escaped
out of a back doore. The rude multitude would not bee satisfied with this, being now
set on by two or three Priests who were joyned with them, and so they began more
violently to batter the Palace gates and walls, having brought pikes, and holbards,
and long poles; others had got a few Pistols, and birding Peeces, wherewith they shot,
not caring whom they killed or wounded in the Palace. It was wonderfull to see
that none of the better sort, none of the Judges, no high Justice, no inferiour Officers
durst or would come out to suppresse the multitude, or to assist the Viceroy being in
so great danger; nay I was told by some shopkeepers who lived in the Market place,
that they made a laughing businesse of it, and the people that passed by went smiling and
saying, Let the boyes and youngsters alone, they will wright our wrongs, they will
find out before they have done, both <i>Tiroll</i> and <i>Mexia</i> and him that protects them,
meaning the Viceroy; but amongst them was much noted one Priest, named <i>Salazar</i>, who
spent much shot and bullets, and more his spirits in running about to spie some
place of advantage, which hee might soonest batter downe. They found it seemes
the prison doores easier to open, or else with helpe within they opened them, and
let out all the malefactors, who joyned with them to assault the Palace. The Viceroy
seeing no helpe came to him from the City, from his friends, from the Judges of
the Chancery, from the Kings high Justices, nor other Officers for the peace, went
up to the <i>Zoties</i> of his Palace with his Guard and Servants that attended on him, and set
up the Royall Standard, and caused a Trumpet to bee sounded to call the City to ayde
and assist their King. But this prevailed not, none stirred, all the chief of the City kept
within doores. And when the multitude saw the Royall Standard out, and heard the
Kings name from the <i>Zoties</i>, they cryed out, and often repeated it, <i>Viva el Rey, muera
el mal govierno, mueran los des comulgados</i>, that is to say, Our King live long, but
let the evill government die, and perish, and let them die that are excommunicated.
These words saved many of them from hanging afterwards, when the businesse was
tried and searched into by <i>Don Martin de Carrillo</i>. And with these words in their
mouths, they skirmished with them of the <i>Zoties</i> at least three houres, they above hurling
downe stones, and they beneath hurling up to them and some shooting with a
few Pistols and birding peeces at one another: and marke that in all this bitter skirmish
there was not a peece of Ordnance shot, for the Viceroy had none for the defence
of his Palace or person, neither had or hath that great City any for its strength and
security, the <i>Spaniards</i> living fearelesse of the <i>Indians</i>, and (as they thinke) secure
from being annoyed by any forraine Nation. There were slain in about six houres in
all that this tumult lasted, seven or eight beneath in the Market place, and one
of the Viceroy his Guard and a page in the <i>Zoties</i> above. The day drawing to an
end, the multitude brought pitch and fire, and first fired the prison, then they
set on fire part of the Palace, and burnt downe the chief gate. This made some
of the City, of the Gentry, and of the Judges to come out, lest the fire should prevaile
farre upon the City, and to perswade the people to desist, and to quench the fire.
Whilest the fire was quenching, many got into the Palace, some fell upon the Viceroyes
stables, and there got part of his mules and horses rich furnitures, others began
to fall upon some chests, others to teare down the hangings, but they were soone
perswaded by the better sort of the City, to desist from spoile or robbery, lest by that
they should bee discovered; other searched about for <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i>, for <i>Tiroll</i>
and the Viceroy. None of them could bee found, having disguised themselves and so
escaped. Whither <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> and <i>Tiroll</i> went, it could not bee knowen in
many dayes; but certaine it was that the Viceroy disguised himselfe in a Franciscan
habit, and so in company of a Fryer went through the multitude to the Cloister of
the Franciscans, where hee abode all that yeer, (and there I saw him the yeere after)
not daring to come out, untill hee had informed the King and Counsell of <i>Spain</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
with what hath happened, and of the danger himselfe and the City was in, if not
timely prevented. The King and Counsell of <i>Spain</i> took the businesse to consideration,
and looked upon it as a warning peece, to a further mutiny and rebellion, and
an example to other parts of <i>America</i> to follow upon any such like occasion, if
some punishment were not inflicted upon the chief offendors. Wherefore the yeere
following 1625. which was when I went to those parts, the King sent a new Viceroy
the Marques of <i>Serralvo</i> to govern in the place of the Count of <i>Gelves</i>, and especially
to aid and assist <i>Don Martin de Carrillo</i> a Priest, and Inquisitor of the Inquisition
of <i>Valladolid</i>, who was sent with large Commission and authority to examine the
foresaid tumult and mutiny, and to judge all offenders that should be found in it, yea
and to hang up such as should deserve death. I was in <i>Mexico</i> in the best time of the
tryall, and had intelligence from <i>Don Martin de Carrillo</i> his owne Ghostly father
a Dominican Fryer of the chief passages in the examination of the businesse; and the
result was, that if Justice should have beene executed rightly, most of the prime of
<i>Mexico</i> would have suffered, for not comming in to the Royall Standard, when called
by the sound of the Trumpet; the Judges some were put out of their places, though
they answered that they durst not stirre out, for that they were informed that all the
City would have risen against them if they had appeared in publick. The chief actors
were found to bee the Criolians or Natives of the Countrey, who doe hate the <i>Spanish</i>
Government, and all such as come from <i>Spain</i>; and reason they have for it, for by
them they are much oppressed, as I have before observed, and are and will bee alwayes
watching any opportunity to free themselves from the <i>Spanish</i> yoke. But the
chief fomenters of the mutiny were found to bee the Bishops party the Preists; and
so had not <i>Salazar</i> and three more of them fled, they had certainly been sent to the
Gallies of <i>Spain</i> for Galley slaves; this judgment was published against them. There
were not above three or foure hanged of so many thousands, and their condemnation
was for things which they had stollen out of the Viceroys Palace. And because
further inquiry into the rebellion would have brought in at least half the City either for
actors, or counsellors, or fomentors, the King was well advised to grant a generall
pardon. The Archbishops proceedings were more disliked in the Court of <i>Spain</i>,
then the Viceroyes, and was long without any preferment; though, at last that there
might be no exceptions taken by his party, nor cause given for a further stirring the embers
to a greater combustion, the Councel thought fit to honor him in those parts where
hee was born; and to make him Bishop of <i>Zamora</i> a small Bishoprick in <i>Castile</i>; so
that his wings were clipt, and from Archbishop hee came to bee but Bishop, and
from threescore thousand Crownes yeerely rent he fell to foure or five thousand onely
a yeere. The count of <i>Gelves</i> was also sent to <i>Spain</i>, and well entertained in the
Court, and therein made Master of the Kings horse, which in <i>Spain</i> is a Noblemans
preferment.</p>

<p>And this History shewing the state and condition of <i>Mexico</i>, when I travelled to
those parts I have willingly set down, that the Reader may by it bee furnished with
better observations then my self (who am but a Neophyte) am able to deduct. Somewhat
might bee observed from the Viceroyes covetousnesse; which doubtlesse in all
is a great sinne, for as <i>Paul</i> well adviseth, I <i>Tim.</i> 6. 10. <i>The love of mony is the root of
all evill</i>; but much more to bee condemned in a Prince or Governour; whom it may
blind in the exercise of Justice and Judgment, and harden those tender bowels
(which ought to bee in him) of a father and shepheard to his flock and children. Wee
may yet from this Viceroyes practice and example against a chiefe head of the <i>Romish</i>
Church, discover that errour of the Preists and Jesuites of <i>England</i>, who perswade the
people here that no temporall Magistrate hath power over them, and that to lay hands
on them in wrath and anger (being as they say Consecrated to God and his Altar)
is <i>ipso facto</i> a deep excommunication; whereas wee see the contrary in this Viceroy a
member of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and yet exercising his temporall power against an
Arch-Bishop, and by <i>Tiroll</i> taking him from the Church, and as his prisoner sending
him with just wrath and anger to a forraine and remote place of banishment. But
lastly it is my desire that the High and Honorable Court of Parliament which now is
sitting for the good of this Kingdome, and for the good of it hath already pulled
downe the Hierarchy of such Prelates and Archprelates, would looke upon the trouble
and uproare which the keys of the Church in the hand of an undiscreet Preist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
brought upon that City of <i>Mexico</i>. Certainly as the strength of the Church well
setled, and governed with subordination to the Magistrate, is likewise the strength
of the Common-wealth; so on the other side the power of the Keyes in the Clergies
hand to cast out what incestuous <i>Corinthian</i> they please, without the rest of the <i>Corinthians</i>
consent, I <i>Cor.</i> 5. 4, 5. may prove dangerous and troublesome to the Common-weale
and good. For if the Clergy may use by itselfe, without the overseeing eye of
the Magistrates Commissioners, the power of the keyes; who shall bee free from
their censures, that any way will oppose them? The poor and ignorant will not onely
bee the object of their censures, but the rich and wise and noble. Ruler and Magistrate
will also come under their censures; wherein I finde a Minister may then as a
Pope encroach upon the highest Crowne of an Emperour. Nay certainly in <i>England</i>
the thoughts of some such aspiring Ministers have been higher then the thoughts of
this Arch-Bishop of <i>Mexico</i> over a Viceroy, the conceipt of their power with the
Keyes have hoised them above their Prince, for I have heard one of them say, he knew
not but that by the power of the keyes hee might as well excommunicate the King as
any other private person. This conceit hath made the Pope of <i>Rome</i> feare no earthly
Prince, Emperour, Ruler or Magistrate; nay this hath made him to bee feared and
respected and honoured by Kings and Princes; And why may not the same power in
the hands of a Protestant Clergy, make the meanest and the highest to feare and dread
them? But some will say, the Word of God being the Touchstone wherewith they
are to try what points may be the subjects of their censures, by such a light and guidance
they are not like to erre. But they then being themselves the Judges of the sense
and meaning of the Word, who shall oppose their judgment, and their ensuing censures?
What if to their triall and judgment they shall bring any Law enacted by a
High Court of Parliament, and shall judge it not according to the Word of God, and so
presse it to the peoples consciences; threatning with their censures such as shall obey it?
in such a case how may the power of the keyes unlock and open a doore to the people
of rebellion against their lawfull Magistrates? Oh what dangers may befall a
Common-wealth, when thus the Clergy shall stand over poor and rich, Subject and
Magistrate, as <i>Peters</i> statue at <i>Rome</i>, with Crosse-keyes in his hand? What a rebellion
did the Archbishop of <i>Mexico</i> cause by excommunicating <i>Don Pedro Mexia</i> first, and
then the Viceroy? and how did the people fear his keyes more then their Viceroys
temporall power and authority, siding with him against such as hee had excommunicated?
What troubles did that Doctor <i>Smith</i> Bishop of <i>Chalcedon</i> bring among the
Papists, small and great ones, not long agoe here in <i>England</i>, laying upon them by
the power of the Keyes a censure of Excommunication, if they confessed to, or did entertaine
and heare the Masse of any, that had not derived their authority from him?
Then were they in open rebellion one against another; the Secular Preists against the
Monkes, Fryers, and Jesuites, and the Laity all troubled, some siding with one, and
some with another, untill Doctor <i>Smith</i> having thus kindled the fire, was faine to
leave it burning, and to betake himself to <i>Paris</i>, and from thence to foment the dissention
which with power of the Keyes hee had caused here.</p>

<p>Oh surely the Church so far is a good Mother, as it allowes a Magistrate to be a Father.
And great comfort have those that live within the pale of the Church, to know
that they have the Magistrate a Father to flye unto in their pressures and discomforts.</p>

<p>I must ingenuously confesse that one maine point that brought me from the Church
of <i>Rome</i>, was the too too great power of the Keyes in the Popes, Bishops, and Preists
hands, who studying more selfe Policy, then common Policy, looke upon the people,
and with their power deale with them more as their subjects, then as politicall
Members in a Common-wealth, rending and tearing them daily by their censures from
that common and Politicall body to which they belong, without any hopes of care
to bee had of them by their Magistrate and Politicall head and Governour. And I
hope I shall not have fled from Antichrist who exalteth himself as head of the Church,
and from that power hath his influence over all State and Politicall Heads and Rulers;
to find in a Protestant Church any of his spirit, making a distinction of a spirituall
and temporall head, forgetting the onely head Christ Jesus; which were it once granted,
as the spirit is more noble then the body, so would the inference soon bee made,
that they that are over the spirit, are higher in power then they that are over the body;
which conclusion would soon bring <i>Mexicoes</i> troubles among Protestants. Experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in all my travails by sea and land, in most parts of <i>Europe</i> and of <i>America</i>, hath ever
taught mee, that where the Clergy hath been too much exalted and enjoyed power over
the people, there the Common-wealth hath soon fallen into heavy pressures and
troubles. And let not this my observation seem strange as coming from a Minister,
for I have learned from Christ, <i>Matth.</i> 20. 25, 26, 27. <i>That the Princes of the Gentiles exercise
Dominion, and they that are great exercise authority. But it shall not bee so among you, but
whosoever will bee great among you, let him bee your Minister; and whosoever will bee chiefe
among you, let him be your Servant.</i></p>

<p>I hope the High Court of Parliament will so settle the Church and State here that this
shall not feare any further troubles from that; and that wee who have our portion
from the one, may bee Ministers and Servants under the Commissioners of the other.
And thus largely I have described the State and condition of <i>Mexico</i> in the time of
<i>Montezuma</i>, and since his death the manner and proportion of it, with the troubled
condition I found it in when I went thither, by reason of a mutiny and rebellion
caused by an Arch-Bishop the yeer before. I shall now come out of <i>Mexico</i>, and present
unto you the places most remarkable about it; and from thence the severall parts
and Countries of <i>America</i>, before I betake my self to the journey which I made from
<i>Mexico</i> to <i>Guatemala</i>, lying nine hundred <i>English</i> miles Southward, and from thence
yet to <i>Costarica</i>, and <i>Nicoya</i>, being nine hundred miles further towards the South.</p>

<h4><i>Shewing the severall parts of this new World of</i> America; <i>and the
places of note about the famous City of</i> Mexico.</h4>


<p>Although my travailes by Sea and Land in <i>America</i> were not above three or
foure thousand miles (which is not the fift part of it, if exactly compassed)
yet for the better compleating of this my worke I thought fit to inlarge
my self to a full division of the many and sundry parts thereof, here first in
generall; and hereafter more in particular of those parts wherein I lived twelve yeeres,
and of those which I more exactly noted and observed as I travailed and passed through
them. The chief division therefore of this greatest part of the World, is twofold
onely, to wit, the <i>Mexicans</i>, and the <i>Peruan</i> parts, which containe many great and
sundry Provinces and Countries, some as big as our whole Kingdom of <i>England</i>. But
<i>Mexico</i> giving name to halfe <i>America</i>, is now called <i>Nova Hispania</i>, new <i>Spain</i>, from
whence the Kings of <i>Spain</i> doe stile themselves, <i>Hispaniarum Reges</i>. The <i>Mexican</i> part
containeth chiefly the Northern Tract, and comprehendeth these Provinces hitherto
knowne and discovered, to wit, <i>Mexico, Quivira, Nicaragua, Jucatan, Florida, Virginia,
Norumbega, Nova Francia, Corterialis</i>, and <i>Estotilandia</i>. The compasse of this part of
<i>America</i> is thirteen thousand miles. The <i>Peruan</i> part containeth all the Southern
Tract, and is tyed to the <i>Mexican</i> by the <i>Isthmus</i> or strait of <i>Darien</i>, being no more
then 17 or as others say, in the narrowest place but 12 miles broad from the North to
the South Sea. And many have mentioned to the Councell of <i>Spain</i>, the cutting
of a Navigable Channell through this small <i>Isthmus</i>, so to shorten the Voiage to <i>China</i>,
and the <i>Moluccoes</i>. But the Kings of <i>Spain</i> have not as yet attempted to doe it, some
say lest in the worke hee should lose those few <i>Indians</i> that are left (would to God
it were so that they were and had been so carefull and tender of the poore <i>Indians</i> lives,
more populous would that vast and spatious Countrey bee at this day:) but others
say he hath not attempted that great worke, lest the passage by the Cape <i>Bona Esperanza</i>
good hope, being left off, those Seas might become a receptacle of Pirates. However
this hath not been attempted by the <i>Spaniards</i>, they give not for reason any extraordinary
great charge, for that would soone bee recompensed with the speedy
and easie conveying that way the Commodities from South to North Seas. This
<i>Peruan</i> part of <i>America</i> containeth these Countries, or Kingdomes, to wit, <i>Castella aurea,
Guiana, Peru, Brasil, Chille</i>; and the compasse of it is seventeen thousand miles. I
shall not speake distinctly of all these parts, which better writers, and of more knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
have before mee discovered; and because some of them being out of the <i>Spaniards</i>
reach and dominion, from whom I have received my best intelligence, I have from them
had little notice of them, nor experience, which indeed I intend to make my best guide
in this my worke. Therefore to returne again to the <i>Mexican</i> part, and the
Northern Tract, I shall fall again upon the first and chiefe member of that division,
which I said was <i>Mexico</i>. This aboundeth with golden sanded rivers, in which are many
Crocodiles (though not so big as those of <i>Egypt</i>), which the <i>Indian</i> people eat.
It glorieth in the mountaines <i>Popochampeche</i>, and <i>Popocatepec</i>, which are of the same
nature with <i>Ætna</i> and <i>Vesuvius</i>. Nay all the way South-ward as farre as <i>Leon</i> in <i>Nicaragua</i>,
there are many of these fiery mountaines. But <i>Popocatepec</i> is one of the
chiefe of them, which signifieth a hill of smoake, for many times it casteth out
smoake and fire; it standeth eight leagues from <i>Chololla</i>; the ascending up unto it is
very troublesome, and full of craggie rocks. When <i>Cortez</i> passed that way to <i>Mexico</i>,
he sent ten <i>Spaniards</i> to view it, with many <i>Indians</i> to carry their victuals, and to
guide them in the way. They approached so nigh the top, that they heard such a terrible
noyse which proceeded from thence, that they durst not goe unto it, for the
ground did tremble and shake, and great quantity of ashes did much disturb their way.
But yet two of them who seemed to be most hardie, and desirous to see strange things,
went up to the top, because they would not return with a sleevelesse answer, and that
they might not be accounted cowards, leaving their fellowes behind them, proceeded
forwards, and passed through that desart of ashes, and at length came under a great
smoake very thick, and standing there a while, the darknesse vanished partly away, and
then appeared the Vulcan and concavity, which is about halfe a league in compasse,
out of the which the aire came rebounding with a very great noise, very shrill and whistling,
so that the whole hill did tremble; it was like unto an oven where glasse is made.
The smoake and heat was so great that they could not abide it, and of force were constrained
to return by the way that they had ascended. But they were not gone farre,
when the Vulcan began to flash out flames of fire, ashes and embers, yea and at the last
stones of burning fire, and if they had not chanced to find a rocke, under which they
shadowed themselves, undoubtedly they had there been burned. It is like unto the
Vulcan of <i>Sicilia</i>, it is high and round, and never wanteth snow about some part of
it. Before the coming of <i>Cortez</i> for ten yeers space it had left off expelling vapour or
smoake; but in the yeer 1540. it began again to burn, and with the horrible noyse
thereof, the people that dwelt four leagues from it were terrified; the ashes that proceeded
then from it reached to <i>Tlaxcallan</i>, which standeth ten leagues distant from it;
yea some affirme that it extended fifteen leagues distant, and burned the herbs in the
gardens, the corne in the fields, and clothes that lay a drying. And many such hils and
mountaines doth this <i>Mexican</i> part of <i>America</i>, or new <i>Spaine</i> abound with. The limits
of it are on the East, <i>Jucatan</i>, and the gulfe of <i>Mexico</i>, on the West <i>Californio</i>, on
the South the <i>Peruan</i> part. The Northern bounds are unknowne, so that we cannot
certainly avow this <i>America</i> to be continent, nor certainly affirme it to be an Island,
distinguished from the old world. It was very populous before the arrivall of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
who in seventeen yeers slew six millions of them, roasting some, plucking out
the eyes, cutting off the arms of others, and casting them living to be devoured of
wilde beasts. This chiefe Province of <i>America</i> named <i>Mexico</i>, is further subdivided
into four parts, that is to say, <i>Themistitan, Nova Galicia, Mechoacan</i>, and <i>Guastachan.
Themistitan</i> is the greatest and noblest of these foure; for that it containeth six
Cities, and of them one is <i>Mexico</i>, which giveth name to the halfe part of <i>America</i>,
and is the seat of an Arch-bishop, and of the <i>Spanish</i> Viceroy, whose greatnesse within
I have before laid open; the second City is <i>La Puebla de las Angeles</i>, the City of
Angels; the third <i>Villaruca</i>, the fourth <i>Antiquera</i>; the fifth <i>Meccioca</i>; the sixth <i>Ottopan</i>.
But all these, excepting the two first, are but small places, named Citties formerly,
for that the <i>Spaniards</i> thought to have made them Bishops seats, which they have not
been able to performe, by reason that <i>Mexico</i> and the City of <i>Angels</i> hath drawne to
them the chiefe trading, and most of the inhabitants of the other foure. Especially
the resort to <i>Mexico</i> is so great, that all the Townes about (which formerly were of <i>Indians</i>)
are now inhabited by <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Mestizoes</i>. I may not omit about <i>Mexico</i> that
famous place of <i>Chapultepec</i>, which in the Heathens times was the burying place of the
Emperours; and now by the <i>Spaniards</i> is the Escuriall of <i>America</i>, where the Viceroyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
that die are also interred. There is a sumptuous palace built with many fair gardens,
and devises of waters, and ponds of fish, whither the Viceroyes and the gentry
of <i>Mexico</i> do resort for their recreation. The riches here belonging to the Viceroyes
Chappell are thought to be worth above a million of crownes.</p>

<p><i>Tacuba</i> is also a pleasant Towne full of orchards and gardens, in the very
way to <i>Chapultepec</i>. South-ward is <i>Toluco</i>, rich also for trading, but above all much mentioned
for the Bacon, which is the best of all those parts, and is transported far and neer.
West-ward is the Towne called, <i>La Piedad</i> at the end of a Cawsey, whither the
people much resort from <i>Mexico</i>, being drawn to the superstitious worship of a picture
of <i>Mary</i>, which hath been enriched by the chiefe of <i>Mexico</i> with many thousand
pounds worth of gifts of chaines, and crownes of gold.</p>

<p>But more Northwest-ward three leagues from <i>Mexico</i> is the pleasantest place of all
that are about <i>Mexico</i>, called <i>La Soledad</i>, and by others <i>el desierto</i>, the solitary or desert
place and wildernesse. Were all wildernesses like it, to live in a wildernesse would be
better then to live in a City. This hath been a device of poor Fryers named discalced,
or barefooted Carmelites, who to make shew of their hypocriticall and apparent godlinesse,
and that whilst they would be thought to live like Eremites, retired from the
world, they may draw the world unto them; they have built there a stately Cloister,
which being upon a hill and among rocks makes it to be more admired. About the
Cloister they have fashioned out many holes and Caves in, under, and among the rocks,
like Eremites lodgings, with a room to lie in, and an Oratory to pray in, with pictures,
and Images, and rare devices for mortification, as disciplines of wyar, rods of iron,
haire-cloths, girdles with sharp wyar pointes to girdle about their bare flesh, and many
such like toyes which hang about their Oratories, to make people admire their mortified
and holy lives. All these Eremeticall holes and caves (which are some ten in all)
are within the bounds and compasse of the Cloister, and among orchards and gardens
full of fruits and flowers, which may take up two miles compasse; and here among
the rockes are many springs of water, which with the shade of the plantins and other
trees, are most coole and pleasant to the Eremites; they have also the sweet smell of
the rose and jazmin, which is a little flower, but the sweetest of all others; there is
not any other flower to be found that is rare and exquisite in that countrey, which is
not in that wildernesse to delight the senses of those mortified Eremites. They are
weekly changed from the Cloister, and when their weeke is ended, others are sent, and
they return unto their Cloister; they carry with them their bottles of wine, sweet-meats,
and other provision; as for fruits the trees about do drop them into their mouthes. It
is wonderfull to see the strange devises of fountains of water which are about the gardens;
but much more strange and wonderfull to see the resort of Coaches, and gallants,
and Ladies, and Citizens from <i>Mexico</i> thither, to walke and make merry in those desart
pleasures, and to see those hypocrites, whom they looke upon as living Saints, and so
think nothing too good for them, to cherish them in their desart conflicts with Satan.
None goes to them but carries some sweet-meats, or some other dainty dish to nourish
and feed them withall; whose prayers they likewise earnestly solicite, leaving them
great almes of mony for their masses; and above all, offering to a picture in their
Church, called our Lady of <i>Carmel</i>, treasures of diamonds, pearles, golden chaines and
crownes, and gownes of cloth of gold and silver. Before this picture did hang in my
time twenty lampes of silver; the worst of them being worth a hundred pound; truely
Satan hath given unto them what he offered Christ in the desart, All these things wil
I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me; all the dainties and of all the riches
of <i>America</i> hath he given unto them in that their desart, for that they daily fall downe
and worship him. In the way to this place there is another Towne yet called <i>Tacubaya</i>,
where is a rich Cloister of Franciscans, and also many gardens and orchards,
but above all much resorted to for the musicke in that Church, wherein the Friers have
made the <i>Indians</i> so dexterous and skilfull, that they dare compare with the Cathedrall
Church of <i>Mexico</i>. These were the chiefe places of mine and my friends resort, whilst
I abode about <i>Mexico</i>, which I found to be most worth a History, and so thought fit
here to insert them, and so passe on to the other parts or Provinces of <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

<p>Next to this is the Province of <i>Guastachan</i>, which lieth in the rode from <i>St. John de
Ulhua</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, which is not so poore as <i>Heylin</i> maketh it, for that now it doth abound
with many rich farmes of Sugar, and of Cochinil, and reacheth as farre as the Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of <i>Guaxaca</i> which is a most rich place. The chiefe City of this Province was wont to be
<i>Tlaxcallan</i>, whereof I have formerly spoken; but now the City of <i>Guaxaca</i> which is a
Bishops seat, and <i>Xalappa</i> which is also of late made a Bishops seat, makes it more famous.
It glorieth also in <i>Villa Rica</i> a Port Towne very wealthy, because all the traffique betwixt
the Old and New <i>Spains</i> do passe through it. The <i>Spaniards</i> have in it two rich Colonies,
called <i>Pamico</i>, and <i>St. James</i> in the valleys. The third Province of <i>Mexico</i> is called
<i>Mechoacan</i>, which containeth in circuit fourscore leagues. It is also an exceeding rich
countrey, abounding in Mulberry trees, silk, hony, wax, black-amber, works of
divers coloured feathers, most rich, rare, and exquisite, and such store of fish, that from
thence it tooke its name, <i>Mechuoucan</i>, which signifieth a place of fishing.</p>

<p>The language of the <i>Indians</i> is most elegant and copious, and they tall, strong, active,
and of very good wits, as may be seen in all their workes, but especially in those
of feathers, which are so curious, that they are presented for rich presents to the
King and Nobles of <i>Spaine</i>. The chiefe City of this Province is <i>Valladolid</i> a Bishops-seat;
and the best Townes are <i>Sinfonte</i>, which was the residence of the Kings of this
countrey. There is also <i>Pascuar</i> and <i>Colima</i> very great Townes inhabited by <i>Indians</i> and
<i>Spaniards</i>. There are also two good havens, called <i>St. Anthony</i>, and <i>St. James</i>, or
<i>Santiago</i>. This country of <i>Mechoacan</i> was almost as great as the Empire of <i>Mexico</i>,
when <i>Cortez</i> conquered those parts. The King that was then of <i>Mechoacan</i> was called
<i>Caconzin</i>, who was a great friend unto <i>Cortez</i>, and a servitor to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and
willingly yeelded himselfe as vassall to the King of <i>Spaine</i>; yet such was the cruelty of
<i>Don Nunio de Guzman</i>, the first Ruler and President of the Chancery of <i>Mexico</i> after
the conquest, that understanding he was put out of his office, he tooke his journey
against the <i>Teuchichimecas</i>, and carried in his company five hundred <i>Spaniards</i>, with
whom and six thousand <i>Indians</i> which by force he tooke out of <i>Mechoacan</i>, he conquered
<i>Xalixco</i> which is now called the new <i>Galicia</i>. And as for this purpose hee passed
through <i>Mechoacan</i>, he tooke Prisoner the King <i>Caconzin</i>, (who was quiet and peaceable
and stirred not against him) and tooke from him ten thousand markes of plate,
and much gold and other treasure, and afterwards burned him, and many other <i>Indian</i>
Gentlemen and principall persons of that Kingdome, because they should not complaine,
saying that a dead dog biteth not. They were in this Kingdome as superstitious
and idolatrous as in the rest of <i>America</i>. No divorcement was permitted amongst
them, except the party made a solemn oath, that they looked not the one on the other
stedfastly and directly at the time of their marriage. In the burying likewise of their
Kings they were superstitious, cruell, and Idolatrous. When any King of <i>Mechoacan</i>
happened to be brought to such extremity of sicknesse that hope of life was past;
then did he name and appoint which of his sons should inherit the state and Crown,
and being known the new King or heir presently sent for all the Governours, Captains,
and valiant souldiers, who had any office or charge, to come unto the buriall of his father,
and he that came not, from thenceforth was held for a Traitour, and so punished.
When the death of the old King was certaine, then came all degrees of estates,
and did bring their presents to the new King for the approbation of his Kingdome:
But if the King were not throughly dead, but at the point of death, then the gates
were shut in, and none permitted to enter; and if he were throughly dead, then began
a generall cry and mourning, and they were permitted to come where their dead
King lay, and to touch him with their hands. This being done the carkasse was washed
with sweet waters, and then a fine shirt put upon him, and a payre of shooes made
of Dear skinne put on his feet, and about his ankles were tied bells of gold, about
the wrists of his hands were put bracelets of Turkises and of gold likewise; about his
neck they did hang collars of pretious stones and also of gold, and rings in his eares,
with a great Turkise in his neither lip. Then his body was laid upon a large Beere
whereon was placed a good bed under him; on his one side lay a bow with a quiver
of arrowes, and on his other side lay an Image made of fine mantles of his own stature
or bignesse, with a great tuffe of fine feathers, shooes upon his feet, with bracelets
and a collar of gold. While this was a doing, others were busied in washing the men
and women, which should be slain for to accompany him into hell. These wretches
that were to be slain, were first banqueted and filled with drinke, because they should receive
their death with lesse paine. The new King did appoint those who should die for
to serve the King his father; and many of those simple soules esteemed that death so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
odious for a thing of immortall glorious. First six Gentlewomen of noble birth were
appointed to die; the one to have the office of keeper of his jewels, which he was
wont to weare; another for the office of cup-bearer; another to give him water with a
bason and Ewer; another to give him alwaies the Urinall; another to be his Cooke;
and another to serve for Landress. They slew also many women, slaves, and free-maidens
for to attend upon the Gentlewomen, and moreover one of every occupation within
the City. When all these that were appointed to die were washed, and their bellies full
with meat and drinke, then they painted their faces yellow, and put garlands of sweet
flowers upon each of their heads. Then they went in order of procession before the
Beere, whereon the dead King was carried; some went playing on instruments made
of Snail shells, and others played upon bones and shells of Sea Tortois, others went
whistling, and the most part weeping. The sons of the dead King and other Noble men
carried upon their shoulders the Beere where the Corps lay, and proceeded with an easie
pace towards the Temple of the God called <i>Curicaveri</i>; his kinsmen went round about
the Beer singing a sorrowfull song. The officers and houshold-servants of the
Court, with other Magistrates and Rulers of justice bare the Standards and divers other
Arms. And about midnight they departed in the order aforesaid out of the Kings
Palace with great light of fire-brands, and with a heavy noyse of their trumpets and
drummes. The Citizens which dwelt where the Corse passed, attended to make clean
the street. And when they were come to the Temple, they went four times round about
a great fire which was prepared of Pine tree to burn the dead body. Then the Beer
was laid upon the fire, and in the meane while that the body was burning, they mawled
with a club those which had the garlands, and afterward buried them four and four
as they were apparelled behind the Temple. The next day in the morning the ashes,
bones and jewels were gathered and laid upon a rich mantle, the which was carried to
the Temple gate, where the Preists attended to blesse those divellish reliques, whereof
they made a dow or paste, and thereof an Image, which was apparelled like a man,
with a visor on his face, and all other sorts of jewels that the dead King was wont to
weare, so that it seemed a gallant Idoll. At the foot of the Temple staires they opened
a grave ready made, which was square, large, two fadome deepe, it was also hanged with
new mats roundabout, and a faire bed therein, in the which one of the Preists placed
the Idoll made of ashes with his eyes towards the East part, and did hang round about
the walls Targets of gold and silver, with bowes and arrows, and many gallant tuffes of
feathers with earthen vessels, as pots, dishes, and platters, so that the grave was filled up
with houshold-stuffe, chests covered with leather, apparel, Jewels, meate drinke and
armour. This done, the grave was shut up and made sure with beames, boardes, and
floored with earth on the top. All those Gentlemen who had served or touched any
thing in the buriall, washed themselves and went to dinner in the Court or yard of the
Kings house without any table, and having dined they wiped their hands upon certain
lockes of Cotton-wooll, hanging downe their heads, and not speaking any word,
except it were to aske for drinke. This ceremonie endured five daies, and in all that
time no fire was permitted to be kindled in the City, except in the Kings house and
Temples, nor yet any corne was ground, or market kept, nor any durst goe out of
their houses, shewing all the sorrow that might be possible for the death of their King.
And this was the superstitious manner of burying the Kings of <i>Mechoacan</i>. This people
did punish adultery most rigorously; for to commit it was death as well for the man as
the woman. But if the adulterer were a Gentleman, his head was decked with feathers,
and after that he was hanged, and his body burned; and for this offence was
no pardon, either for man or woman. But for avoiding of adultery they did permit other
common women, but no publike and ordinary stewes. Now the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Mechoacan</i>
are greatly taken with the popish devices, and are strong in that religion, as any
part of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth and last Province of the Countrey or Empire of <i>Mexico</i>, is called <i>Galicia
nova</i>, and is watered with two very great rivers, the one named <i>Piastle</i>, and the other
<i>San Sebastian</i>. This Province glorieth in many great Townes of <i>Indians</i>; but especially
in six, inhabited both by <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>; the first and chiefest is <i>Xalisco</i>,
taken by <i>Nunio de Guzman</i> 1530. when he fled from <i>Mexico</i> in a rage, and tooke prisoner
and burned the King of <i>Mechoacan</i>. The second is <i>Guadalaiara</i>. The third <i>Coanum</i>.
The fourth <i>Compostella</i>. The fifth, <i>St. Espirit</i>. The sixth, <i>Capola</i>, which now is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<i>Nova Mexico</i>, new <i>Mexico</i>. And here it is that the <i>Spaniards</i> are daily warring against
the <i>Indians</i> which live Northward, and are not as yet reduced nor brought under the
<i>Spanish</i> yoake and government. They are valiant <i>Indians</i>, and hold the <i>Spaniards</i> hard
to it; and have great advantage against them in the rocks and mountaines, where they
abide and cut off many <i>Spaniards</i>. Their chief weapons are but bowes and arrowes,
and yet with them from the thick Woods, hils and rockes they annoy and offend
the <i>Spaniards</i> exceedingly. I have heard some <i>Spaniards</i> say that they flie and climbe
up the rocks like Goates; and when they draw nigh unto them, then they cry out
with a hideous noise shooting their arrowes at them, and in an instant are departed
and fled unto another rock. The reason why the <i>Spaniards</i> are so earnest to pursue
and conquer these <i>Indians</i>, more then many others of <i>America</i>, which as yet are not
brought in subjection to the <i>Spaniards</i>, is for the many Mines of silver and treasure of
gold which they know to bee there. They have got already sure possession of part
of those riches in the Mines, called St. <i>Lewis Sacatecas</i>, from whence they send all
the silver that is coyned in the Mint houses of <i>Mexico</i> and the City of <i>Angels</i>, and every
yeere besides to <i>Spain</i> in silver wedges at least six Millions. But the further the
<i>Spaniards</i> goe to the North, still more riches they discover; and faine would they
subdue all those Northern parts (as I have heard them say) lest our <i>English</i> from
<i>Virginia</i>, and their other plantations, get in before them. I have heard them wonder
that our <i>English</i> enter no further into the maine land; surely say they, either they
feare the <i>Indians</i>, or else with a little paultry Tobacco they have as much as will
maintaine them in lazinesse. Certainly they intend to conquer through those heathenish
<i>Indians</i>, untill by land they come to <i>Florida</i> and <i>Virginia</i>, (for so they boast) if
they bee not met with by some of our Northern Nations of <i>Europe</i>, who may better
keep them off then those poor <i>Indians</i>, and may doe God greater and better service with
those rich Mines, then the <i>Spaniards</i> hitherto have done.</p>

<p>Thus having spoken somewhat of the foure Provinces of <i>Mexico</i>, which was the
first member of the division <i>Mexican</i> and <i>Peruan</i>; Now I shall briefly say somewhat
further of three more Countries belonging to the <i>Mexican</i> or Northern Tract as opposite
to the <i>Peruan</i>, omiting <i>Florida, Virginia, Norumbega, Nova Francia Corterialis</i>,
and <i>Estotilandia</i>, because I will not write as many doe by relation and hearsay, but
by more sure intelligence, insight and experience. In my first division next to <i>Mexico</i>,
I placed <i>Quivira, Jucatan</i>, and <i>Nicaragua</i>; of these three therefore I shall say a little,
and then some what of the <i>Peruan</i> part. <i>Quivira</i> is seated on the most Western
part of <i>America</i>, just over against <i>Tartary</i>, from whence being not much distant some
suppose that the Inhabitants first came into this new World. And indeed the <i>Indians</i> of
<i>America</i> in many things seeme to bee of the race and progenie of the <i>Tartars</i>, in that
<i>Quivira</i> and all the West side of the Country towards <i>Asia</i> is farre more populous
then the East towards <i>Europe</i>, which sheweth these parts to have been first inhabited.
Secondly, their uncivility, and barbarous properties tell us that they are most like
the <i>Tartars</i> of any. Thirdly, the West side of <i>America</i> if it bee not continent with <i>Tartary</i>,
is yet disjoyned by a small straight. Fourthly, the people of <i>Quivira</i> neerest to
<i>Tartary</i>, are said to follow the seasons and pasturing of their cattell like the <i>Tartarians</i>.
All this side of <i>America</i> is full of herbage, and injoyeth a temperate aire. The
people are desirous of glasse more then of gold; and in some places to this day are
Cannibals. The chief riches of this Country are their Kine, which are to them as we
say of our Ale to drunkards, meat, drink and cloth, and more too. For the Hides yeeld
them houses, or at least the coverings of them; their bones bodkins, their hair thred,
their sinews ropes; their horns, mawes and bladders, vessels; their dung, fire; their
Calve skinnes, budgets to draw and keepe water; their blood, drink; their flesh,
meat.</p>

<p>There is thought to bee some traffique from <i>China</i>, or <i>Cathaya</i>, hither to those parts,
where as yet the <i>Spaniards</i> have not entred. For when <i>Vazquez de Coronado</i> conquered
some part of it, hee saw in the further Sea certaine ships, not of common making;
which seemed to bee well laden, and bare in their prowes, Pelicans, which could not
bee conjectured to come from any Country, but one of these two. In <i>Quivira</i> there
are but two Provinces knowne unto us, which are <i>Cibola</i>, and <i>Nova Albion. Cibola</i> lyeth
on the Eastside, whose chief City is of the same name, and denominates the whole
Province. The chief Town next to <i>Cibola</i> is called <i>Totontaa</i>, which is temperate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
pleasant, being situated upon a River so called. The third Town worth mentioning is
called <i>Tinguez</i>, which was burnt by the <i>Spaniards</i>; who under the conduct of <i>Francisco
Vasquez de Coronado</i> made this Province subject to the King of <i>Spain, Anno Dom.</i>
1540. And since this Town of <i>Tinguez</i> hath been rebuilt and inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i>;
There is a goodly Colledge of Jesuites, who only preach to the <i>Indians</i> of that country.
<i>Nova Albion</i> lyeth on the West side towards <i>Tartary</i>, and is very little inhabited by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who have found no wealth or riches there. Our ever Renowned and Noble
Captain Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> discovered it, entred upon it, and hee named it <i>Nova Albion</i>,
because the King that then was, did willingly submit himself unto our Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>The Country abounds with fruits pleasing both the eye and the Palate. The people
are given to hospitality, but withall to witchcraft and adoration of devils. The
bounds between this <i>Quivira</i> and <i>Mexico</i> Empire is <i>Mar Virmiglio</i>, or <i>Californio</i>. The
third Kingdome belonging to the <i>Mexican</i> part and Northern Tract is <i>Jucatan</i>;
which was first discovered by <i>Francisco Hernandez de Cordova</i>, in the year 1517. It is called
<i>Jucatan</i>, not as some have conceited from <i>Joctan</i> the son of Heber, who they thinke
came out of the East, where the Scripture placeth him, <i>Gen.</i> 12. 23. to inhabite here,
but from <i>Jucatan</i> which in the <i>Indian</i> tongue, signifieth, what say you? for when the
<i>Spaniards</i> at their first arriving in that Country did aske of the <i>Indians</i> the name of the
place, the Savages not understanding what they meaned, replyed unto them <i>Jucatan</i>,
which is, what say you? whereupon the <i>Spaniards</i> named it, and ever since have called
it <i>Jucatan</i>. The whole Country is at least 900 miles in circuit, and is a <i>Peninsula</i>.
It is situated over against the Isle of <i>Cuba</i>; and is divided into three parts, first <i>Jucatan</i>
it selfe, whose Cities of greatest worth, are <i>Campeche, Valladolid, Merida, Simaricas</i>,
and one which for his greatnesse and beauty, they call <i>Caire</i>. This Country
among the <i>Spaniards</i> is held to bee poor; the chief Commodities in it are hony, wax,
Hides, and some Sugar, but no Indigo, Cochinil, nor Mines of silver; There are yet
some drugs much esteemed of by the Apothecaries, <i>Cana fistula, Zarzaparilla</i> especially;
and great store of <i>Indian Maiz</i>. There is also abundance of good Wood and Timber
fit for shipping, whereof the <i>Spaniards</i> doe make very strong ships, which they
use in their voiages to <i>Spain</i> and back again. In the yeer 1632. the <i>Indians</i> of this
Country in many places of it were like to rebell against their <i>Spanish</i> Governour, who
vexed them sorely, making them bring in to him their Fowles and Turkies (whereof
there is also great abundance) and their hony and wax, (wherein hee traded) at the rate
and price which hee pleased to set them for his better advantage; which was such a disadvantage
to them, that to enrich him they impoverished themselves; and so resolved
to betake themselves to the Woods and Mountaines; where in a rebellious way
they continued some Months, untill the Franciscan Fryers, who have there great
power over them, reduced them back, and the Governour (lest hee should quite lose
that Country by a further rebellion) granted to them not onely a generall pardon
in the Kings name, but for the future promised to use them more mildly and gently.</p>

<p>The second part of it is called <i>Guatemala</i>, (wherein I lived for the space of almost twelve
yeers) whose Inhabitants have lost formerly halfe a million of their kinsmen and
friends by the unmercifull dealing of the <i>Spaniards</i>; and yet for all the losse of so
many thousands, there is no part of <i>America</i> more flourishing then this with great
and populous <i>Indians</i> Townes. They may thank the Fryers who defend them daily
against the <i>Spaniards</i> cruelty, and this yet for their owne ends; for while the <i>Indians</i>
flourish and increase, the Fryers purses flourish also and are filled. This Country is very
fresh and plentifull. The chief Cities are <i>Guatemala, Cassuca</i>, and <i>Chiapa</i>; whereof
I shall speak more largely hereafter. The third part of <i>Jucatan</i> is <i>Acasamil</i>, which is
an Island over against <i>Guatemala</i> which is now commonly called by the <i>Spaniards
Sta Cruz</i>, whose chief Towne is <i>Sta. Cruz</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth and last Country of the division of the <i>Mexican</i> part and Northern Tract
of <i>America</i> (which is under the <i>Spanish</i> Government, and my best knowledge and
experience) is <i>Nicaragua</i>, which standeth South East from <i>Mexico</i>, and above foure
hundred and fifty leagues from it. Yet it agreeth somewhat with <i>Mexico</i> in nature both
of soile and Inhabitants. The people are of good stature, and of colour indifferent
white. They had, before they received Christianity, a setled and politick forme of
Government; Onely, as <i>Solon</i> appointed no Law for a mans killing of his father, so
had this people none for the murtherer of a King, both of them conceiting, that men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were not so unnaturall, as to commit such crimes. A theef they judged not to death,
but adjudged him to be slave to that man whom hee had robbed; till by his service
hee had made satisfaction: a course truely more mercifull and not lesse just, then the
losse of life.</p>

<p>This Countrey is so pleasing to the eye, and abounding in all things necessary,
that the <i>Spaniards</i> call it <i>Mahomets</i> Paradise. Among other flourishing trees, here groweth
one of that nature, that a man cannot touch any of its branches, but it withereth
presently. It is as plentifull of Parrets, as our Countrey of <i>England</i> is of Crowes; Turkies,
Fowles, Quailes and Rabbets are ordinary meat there. There are many populous
<i>Indian</i> Townes (though not so many as about <i>Guatemala</i>) in this Countrey; and especially
two Cities of <i>Spaniards</i>, the one <i>Leon</i>, a Bishops Seat, and the other <i>Granada</i>,
which standeth upon a Lake of fresh water, which hath above three hundred miles in
compasse, and having no intercourse with the Ocean, doth yet continually ebbe and
flow. But of this Countrey, and of this City especially I shall say somewhat more, when
I come to speake of my travailing through it.</p>

<p>Thus I have briefly touched upon the <i>Mexican</i> part, and so much of the Northern
Tract as is under the King of <i>Spain</i> his Dominion, leaving more particulars, untill I
come to shew the order of my being in and journeying through some of these Countries.
I will now likewise give you a glimpse of the Southern Tract, and <i>Peruan</i> part
of <i>America</i>. Which containeth chiefly five great Countries or Kingdomes, some in whole,
and others in part, subject to the Crown of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, which are, first <i>Castella
aurea</i>; secondly, <i>Gujana</i>; thirdly, <i>Peru</i>; fourthly, <i>Brasile</i>; fifthly, <i>Chille</i>. But I will not
fill my History with what others have written of the foure last named Countries,
wherein I was not much; but what I could learne of <i>Peru</i>, I will briefly speak, and
so come to the first <i>Castella aurea</i>, through which I travailed. <i>Peru</i> is held to be yet more
rich a Countrey then is <i>Mexico</i>; for although it hath not the conveniency of trafique
by the North Sea, which <i>Mexico</i> hath; but doth send the Commodities in it to <i>Panama</i>,
and from thence transports them either over the straight <i>Isthmus</i>, or by the River <i>Chiagre</i>
to <i>Portabel</i> upon the North Sea; yet the Countrey is farre richer then <i>Mexico</i>, by
reason of the more abundance of Mines of silver which are in it. The mountaines named
<i>Potosi</i> are thought to be of no other metall, which the King of <i>Spain</i> will not
have to be opened until they have exhausted those which are already discovered and digged,
and have found the <i>Spaniards</i> worke enough, and yeelded them treasure enough
ever since they first conquered those parts. The soile is very fruitfull of all such fruits
as are found in <i>Spain</i>. The Olives are bigger then those of <i>Spain</i>, the oyle sweeter and
cleerer. The Grapes yeeld also a wine farre stronger then any of <i>Spain</i>, and there is
much made, by reason it cannot conveniently bee brought from <i>Spain</i>. There is likewise
wheat in great store; and all this fruitfull soile lyeth low under high Mountaines
which divide betwixt <i>Indians</i> not as yet conquered and <i>Brasile</i>. But those Mountaines
are a great helpe unto those pleasant Valleys with the waters that fall from them;
for in all those parts inhabited by <i>Spaniards</i> towards the South Sea, it is most certain
and most observable that it never raineth, in so much that the houses are uncovered
on the tops, and onely matts laid over them to keep off the dust, and yet is this Countrey
what with the waters that fall from the Mountaines, what with the morning and
evening dewes, as fruitfull and plentifull as any Countrey in the World. The chief
City is called <i>Lima</i>, where there is a Viceroy and a Court of Chancery, and an Arch-Bishop.
It hath a Port some two miles from it named <i>Callau</i>; where lie the ships that
convey yearly the treasure of that Kingdome to <i>Panama</i>. There lie also other ships,
which trafique to the <i>East-India's</i>, and to all the Coasts of <i>Guatemala</i>, and to <i>Acapulco</i>
the Southern Haven of <i>Mexico</i>. This Port of <i>Callau</i> is not so strong as the great,
nay inestimable wealth that is commonly in it and in the City of <i>Lima</i> should require,
for I have heard many <i>Spaniards</i> say, that in the yeare 1620. a few ships of <i>Hollanders</i>
(as some say) or of <i>English</i> (as others affirme) appeared before the Haven
waiting for the ships that were to convey the Kings revenews to <i>Panama</i>, and hearing
that they were departed (though by a false report) followed them, and so forsooke
the attempting to take the <i>Callau</i>; which certainly had they manly attempted,
they had taken it, and in it the greatest treasure that in any one part of the world
could have beene found. But the <i>Spaniards</i> seldome see thereabout foraine ships,
and so live more carelesly in securing or strengthning that Coast. Though <i>Peru</i> bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
thus rich in fruits and Mines, yet <i>Chille</i> farre exceedeth it in gold; which edgeth the
<i>Spaniards</i> to a constant and continuall Warre with the Inhabitants, which are a strong,
warlike, and most valiant people. They are grown as skilfull in the use of weapons,
swords, Pistols and Muskets as the <i>Spaniards</i>, and have taken many <i>Spaniards</i>, men
and women prisoners; and or the <i>Spanish</i> women have had so many children, called
<i>Mestizoes</i>, that by them (who have proved most valiant) they have much increased
both their strength and skill. They hold the <i>Spaniards</i> hard to it, and the War is become
the most dangerous of any the <i>Spaniards</i> have; in so much that the Counsell of
<i>Spain</i> doth pick out from <i>Flanders</i> and <i>Italy</i>, the best souldiers to send them thither.
And a Captaine that hath served long, well and faithfully in <i>Flanders</i>, by way of credit
and promotion is sent to the Warres of <i>Chille</i>, to fight for that great treasure of gold,
which certainly is there. The <i>Spaniards</i> have in it three faire Cities; the <i>Conception</i>
(which is a Bishops Seat) and <i>Santiago</i>, and <i>Valdivia</i>. This last is so named from
one <i>Valdivia</i>, who was Governour of it, and the first cause and author of those Wars.</p>

<p>This man was so extraordinarily covetous of the gold of that Countrey, that hee
would not let the <i>Indians</i> possesse or injoy any of it themselves; but did vex them,
whip, and beat, yea and kill some of them, because they brought him not enough,
and imployed them daily in seeking it out for him, charging them with a tax and imposition
of so much a day: which the <i>Indians</i> not being able to performe, nor to satisfie
an unsatiable minde and greedy covetousnesse, resolved to rebell, but so that first
they would fill and satiate his heart with gold so that hee should never more covet after
that yellow and glittering metall. Wherefore they joyned and combined themselves
together in a warlike posture, and tooke some quantity of gold and melted it,
and with it resolutely came upon <i>Valdivia</i> the Governour, saying, O <i>Valdivia</i> we see
thou hast a greedy and unsatiable minde and desire after our gold; wee have not been
able to satisfie thee with it hitherto; but now wee have devised a way to satiate this
thy greedy covetousnesse; here is now enough, drink thy full of it; and with these
words they tooke him, and powred the melted gold downe his throat, wherewith
he died, never more coveting after that bright and shining drosse, and naming with his
name and death that City of <i>Valdivia</i>, and with his covetousnesse leaving a rebellion
which hath continued to a cruell and bloody War unto this day.</p>

<p><i>Guiana</i> and <i>Brasile</i> I shall omit to speak of, not having been in any part of them. <i>Brasile</i>
is little talked of by the <i>Spaniards</i>, belonging to the Crowne of <i>Portugall</i>, and
now part of it to the high and mighty States of the <i>Netherlands</i>, who will better satisfie
by their Histories, and acquaint <i>Europe</i> with the riches that are in it.</p>

<p>I return unto the first part mentioned by me in the Southern and <i>Peruan</i> Tract, which
was said to bee <i>Castella aurea</i>, golden <i>Castile</i>, so called for the abundance of gold that
is found in it. This containeth the Northern part of <i>Peruana</i>, and part of the <i>Isthmus</i>,
which runneth between the North and South Sea. Besides the gold in it, yet it is admirably
stored with silver, Spices, Pearls, and medicinall Herbes. It is divided into
foure Provinces. The first is called <i>Castella del oro</i>; the second, <i>Nova Andaluzia</i>; the
third <i>Nova Granada</i>; the fourth, <i>Carthagena. Castella del oro</i> is situated in the very <i>Isthmus</i>,
and is not very populous by reason of the unhealthfulnesse of the aire, and noisome
savour of the standing pooles. The chief places belonging to the <i>Spaniards</i>,
are first <i>Theonimay</i>, or <i>Nombre de Dios</i> on the East; the second, which is six leagues from
<i>Nombre de Dios</i> is <i>Portabel</i>, now chiefly inhabited by the <i>Spaniards</i> and Mulattoes, and
Blackmores, and <i>Nombre de Dios</i> almost utterly forsaken by reason of its unhealthfulnesse.
The ships which were wont to anchor in <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, and there to take in
the Kings treasure, which is yeerly brought from <i>Peru</i> to <i>Panama</i>, and from thence to
the North Sea, now harbour themselves in <i>Portabel</i>; which signifyeth <i>Porto bello</i>, a
faire and goodly Haven, for so indeed it is, and well fortified at the entrance with three
Castles, which can reach and command one another. The third and chiefe place belonging
to the <i>Spaniards</i> in <i>Castella del oro</i> is <i>Panama</i>, which is on the Westside and
upon the South Sea. This City and <i>Nombre de Dios</i> were both built by <i>Didacus de
Niquesa</i>. And <i>Nombre de Dios</i> was so called, because <i>Niquesa</i> having been crossed with
many mischances and misadventures at Sea, when hee came to this place greatly rejoyced,
and bad his men now goe on shore in <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, in the name of God.
But as I have before observed, the aire being here very unhealthy, the
King of <i>Spain</i> in the yeare 1584. commanded the houses of <i>Nombre de Dios</i> to be pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
downe, and to be rebuilt in a more healthy and convenient place: which was performed
by <i>Peter Arias</i> in <i>Portabel</i>. But being now upon <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, I should wrong my
Country if I should not set out to the publike view the worth of her people shewed upon
this place, and to this day talked on and admired by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who doe not only
remember Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, &amp; teach their children to dread and fear even his name
for his attempts upon <i>Carthagena</i> and all the coast about, and especially upon <i>Nombre
de Dios</i>, and from it marching as farre as the great mountaine called <i>St. Pablo</i> towards
<i>Panama</i>: but furthermore keep alive amongst them (and in this my History it shall not
die) the name of one of Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> his followers and Captains named <i>John
Oxenham</i>, whose attempt on this coast was resolute and wonderfull.</p>

<p>This Noble and gallant Gentleman arriving with threescore and ten souldiers in his
company as resolute as himselfe, a little above this Towne of <i>Nombre de Dios</i> drew a
land his ship, and covering it with boughes, marched over the land with his Company
guided by <i>Black-mores</i>, untill he came to a river. Where he cut downe wood, made
him a Pinnace, entred the South-sea, went to the Island of Pearles, where hee lay
ten daies waiting for a prize, which happily he got (though not so happily after kept it)
for from that Island he set upon two <i>Spanish</i> ships, and finding them unable to fight, he
speedily made them yeeld, and intercepted in them threescore thousand pound weight
of gold, and two hundred thousand pound weight in barres or wedges of silver, and
returned safely again to the maine land. And though by reason of a mutiny made
by his owne Company he neither returned to his country nor to his hidden ship; yet
was it such a strange adventure as is not to be forgotten, in that the like was never by
any other attempted, and by the <i>Spaniards</i> is to this day with much admiration recorded.</p>

<p>Much part of this <i>Castella aurea</i> as yet is not subdued by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and so doubtlesse
a great treasure lieth hid in it for that people and nation whose thoughts shall aspire
to find it out. In the year 1637. when I chanced to be in <i>Panama</i> returning homewards
to my Country, there came thither some twenty <i>Indians</i> Barbarians by way of
peace to treate with the President of the Chancery concerning their yeelding up themselves
to the government of the King of <i>Spaine</i>. But as I was informed afterwards at
<i>Carthagena</i>, nothing was concluded upon, for that the <i>Spaniards</i> dare not trust those
<i>Indians</i>, whom they have found to have rebelled often against them for their
hard usage and carriage towards them. These <i>Indians</i> which then I saw were very proper,
tall and lusty men, and well complexioned; and among them one of as red a
haire as any our nation can shew; they had bobs of gold in their eares, and some of
them little pieces of gold made like a halfe moone hanging upon their neither lips,
which argues store of that treasure to be amongst them. Unto this country is joyning
<i>Nova Andaluzia</i>, which hath on the North side <i>Castella del oro</i>, and on the South
<i>Peru</i>; The best Cities in it are <i>Tocoio</i>, now by the <i>Spaniards</i> called <i>St. Margarets</i>, and
another called <i>S. Espiritu. Nova Granada</i> is situated on the South side of <i>Carthagena</i>, and
from the abundance and fertility of <i>Granada</i> in <i>Spaine</i> it hath taken its name. The chiefe
Townes and Cities in it are six. First <i>Tungia</i>, which is supposed to be directly under
the <i>Æquator</i>. The second is <i>Tochaimum</i>. The third, <i>Popaian</i>, the richest of them all.
The fourth, <i>Sta. Fee</i>, or <i>St. Faith</i>, an Archbishops seat, and a Court of Justice and
Chancery, governed like <i>Panama</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>, by a President and six Judges, and
a Kings Attorney and two high Justices of Court, who have six thousand duckats a
yeer allowed them out of the Kings treasure. The fifth City is <i>Palma</i>; and the sixth
<i>Merida</i>. From <i>Carthagena</i> through this countrey of <i>Granada</i> lieth the rode way to <i>Lima</i>
in <i>Peru</i>, all by land. This Country is very strong by reason of the situation of
it much amongst stony rockes, which compasse and environ it, and through which
there are very narrow passages. Yet it is full of pleasant valleys which do yeeld much
fruit, Corne and <i>Indian</i> Maiz. There are also in it some Mines of silver, and many
golden sanded rivers. <i>Carthagena</i>, which is the last Province of <i>Castella aurea</i>, hath also
a very fruitfull soil, in the which groweth a tree, which if any one do touch, he
will hardly escape a poysoning.</p>

<p>The chiefe Cities in it are, first <i>Carthagena</i>, which Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> in the yeer 1585.
surprised, and (as the <i>Spaniards</i> affirme) burned most part of it, and besides inestimable
sums of money, took with him from thence 230 peeces of Ordnance. I dare say now
it hath not so many; yet it is reasonable well fortified; though not so strong as <i>Portabel</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
It is a faire and gallant City and very rich, by reason of the pearles which are
brought to it from <i>Margarita</i>, and the Kings revenues, which from all <i>Nova Granada</i>
are sent thither. It is a Bishops seat, and hath many rich Churches and Cloisters. It
is not governed by a Court of Justice and Chancery as <i>Sta. Fee</i> is, but onely by one
Governour. It hath been often moved to the Councell of <i>Spaine</i> to have some Galleys
made to runne about those Seas, and that <i>Carthagena</i> bee the chiefe harbour of them.
From this City received <i>England</i> the losse of that little Island named <i>Providence</i> by us,
and by the <i>Spaniards Sta. Catalina</i>, which though but little, might have been of a great,
nay greater advantage to our Kingdom, than any other of our plantations in <i>America</i>;
which the <i>Spaniards</i> wel understood when they set al their strength of <i>Carthagena</i> against
it; but I hope the Lord hath his time appointed when we shall advantage our selves by it
again. To this City of <i>Carthagena</i> cometh every yeer also in small Frigots most of the Indigo,
Cochinil &amp; Sugar, which is made in the country of <i>Guatemala</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i> thinking
it safer to ship these their goods in little Frigots upon the lake of <i>Granada</i> in <i>Nicaragua</i>,
&amp; from thence to send them to <i>Carthagena</i> to be shipped with the Galeons that come
from <i>Portabel</i> with the treasure of <i>Peru</i>, than to send them by the ships of <i>Honduras</i>, which
have often been a prey unto the <i>Hollanders</i>. These frigots were thought by the <i>Spaniards</i>
to come too neer the reach of <i>Providence</i>, and therefore it hath been their care and providence
to remove us from this reach of their Frigots. The second great Towne of this
Countrey of <i>Carthagena</i> is <i>Abuida</i>. The third <i>Sta. Martha</i>, which is a rich government of
<i>Spaniards</i>, and doth much fear our <i>English</i> and <i>Holland</i> ships; it is seated on the river <i>de Abuida</i>,
otherwise called <i>St. John</i> and <i>Rio di Grand</i>. There is also <i>Venezuela</i> and <i>New-Caliz</i>,
great, rich, and strong Townes. And these three last regions, <i>Andaluzia Nova, Nova
Granada</i>, and <i>Carthagena</i> are by the <i>Spaniards</i> called <i>Tierra firme</i>, or firme land, for that
they are the strength of <i>Peru</i> from the North, and the basis of this reversed <i>Pyramis</i>.</p>

<p>Thus have I brought thee, Gentle Reader, round about <i>America</i>, and shewed thee
the Continent of that biggest part of the world; from the which thou mayst observe
the power and greatnesse of the King of <i>Spain</i>, who hath got under his Scepter and
Dominion so many thousand miles, which were they reckoned up, would be found to
be more then are about all <i>Europe</i>. But not only is <i>America</i> great and spatious by land, but
also by sea, glorying in more and some greater Islands, then any other part of the world.
It would but cause tediousnesse, and seem prolixity to number them all up, which is
a worke hard and difficult, for that many as yet are not knowne nor inhabited, and
whose goodnesse and greatnesse is not discovered; for the Islands called <i>Lucoidas</i> are
thought to be foure hundred at least. Therefore I will omit to be over tedious and prolixe,
and will but briefly speake of the best and chiefe of them, taking them in order
from that part of the Continent, <i>Carthagena</i>, where even now I left thee. But in the
first place calls upon my pen the Jewel Island called <i>Margarita</i>, which is situated in the
sea nigh unto <i>Castella aurea</i>, and not farre distant from two other Islands, named <i>Cubagna</i>
and <i>Trinidado</i>. True it is this Island of <i>Margarita</i> is by some much slighted for want
of corne, grasse, trees and water; in so much that it hath been knowne sometime
that an inhabitant of that Island hath willingly changed for a Tun of water a Tunne
of wine. But the great abundance of pretious stones in it maketh amends for the former
wants and defects; for from them is the name of <i>Margarita</i> imposed on that Island.
But especially it yeeldeth store of pearles, those gemmes which the Latine writers
call <i>Uniones</i>, because <i>nulli duo reperiuntur indiscreti</i>, they alwaies are found to grow
in couples. In this Island there are many rich Merchants, who have thirty, fourty,
fifty <i>Black-more</i> slaves only to fish out of the sea about the rockes these pearles. These
<i>Black-mores</i> are much made of by their Masters, who must needs trust them with a treasure
hidden in the waters, and in whose will it is to passe by of those they find, none, few,
or many. They are let downe in baskets into the Sea, and so long continue under
the water, untill by pulling the rope by which they are let downe, they make their sign
to taken up. I have heard some say that have thus dealt in pearles, that the chief meat
they feed their <i>Black-mores</i> with, is roast-meat, which maketh them their wind &amp; breath
longer in the water. From <i>Margarita</i> are all the pearles sent to be refined and bored to
<i>Carthagena</i>, where is a faire and goodly street of no other shops then of these Pearle-dressers.
Commonly in the moneth of <i>July</i> there is a ship or two at most ready in that
Island to carry the Kings revenue, and the Merchants pearles to <i>Carthagena</i>. One of these
ships are valued commonly at threescore thousand, or fourscore thousand duckats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and sometimes more; and therefore are reasonable well manned; for that the <i>Spaniards</i>
much feare our <i>English</i> and the <i>Holland</i> ships. The yeare that I was in <i>Carthagena</i>,
which was 1637. a ship of these laden with pearles was chased by one of our ships from the
Island of <i>Providence</i> (by some it was thought to be our ship called the <i>Neptune</i>) which
after a little fighting had almost brought the poore <i>Spaniard</i> to yeeld his pearles, and
had certainly carried away that great treasure (as I was informed in <i>Carthagena</i> foure
daies after the fight by a <i>Spaniard</i> who was in the ship of <i>Margarita</i>) had not two other
ships of <i>Holland</i> come between to challenge from our <i>English</i> man that prize, alleadging
their priviledge from the mighty States united for all prizes upon those seas and
coast. And whilst our <i>English</i> and <i>Hollander</i> did thus strive for the Pearles, the <i>Spanish</i>
ship ran on shore upon a little Island, and speedily unladed and hid in the woods part
of the treasures, and perceiving the <i>Hollander</i> coming eagerly in pursuit of it, the <i>Spaniard</i>
set on fire the ship, and neither <i>Spaniard, English</i>, nor <i>Hollander</i>, enjoyed what
might have been a great and rich prize to <i>England</i>. From <i>Carthagena</i> was sent presently
a man of Warre to bring home the pearles hid in the wood, which were not the third
part of what was in the ship.</p>

<p><i>Jamaica</i> is another Island under the power of the <i>Spaniards</i>, which is in length 280.
miles, and 70. in breadth, which though it exceed <i>Margarita</i> in sweet and pleasant
streames and fountaines of water, yet is far inferiour to it in riches. Some Hides, some
Sugar, and some Tobacco are the chiefe commodities from thence. There are only
two Townes of note in it, <i>Oristana</i> and <i>Sevilla</i>; here are built ships which have proved
as well at sea, as those that are made in <i>Spaine</i>. This Island was once very populous,
but now is almost destitute of <i>Indians</i>; for the <i>Spaniards</i> have slain in it more then
60,000; in so much that women as well here as on the Continent did kill their children
before they had given them life, that the issues of their bodies might not serve so cruell
a nation. But farre beyond the two former is the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, which is three hundred
miles long, and seventy broad, which was first made knowne to <i>Europe</i> by <i>Columbus</i>
his second navigation. This Island is full of Forrests, Lakes, and mountaines. The
aire is very temperate, the soile very fertill, producing brasse of exact perfection, and
some gold though drossie hath formerly been found in it. It aboundeth also with Ginger,
Cassia, Masticke, Aloes, some Cinnamon, Cana fistula, Zarzaparilla, and
Sugar, and hath of flesh, fish, and fowles great plenty; but especially such store of
sea Tortois, and Hogs, that the ships at their returne to <i>Spaine</i> make their chiefe provision
of them. My selfe chanced to take physicke there, and whereas I thought that
day I should have a fowle or rabbet after my physicks working, they brought me a boyled
peece of fresh young Porke, which when I refused to eat, they assured me it was the
best dish the Doctors did use to prescribe upon such daies.</p>

<p>The chiefe Cities of this Island are <i>Santiago</i> on the Northerne shore, built by <i>James
de Valasco</i>, a Bishops seat, and secondly, <i>Havana</i>, which is also on the Northerne shore, and
is a safe Rode for ships, and the staple of merchandize, and (as the <i>Spaniards</i> call it)
the key of all the <i>West-India's</i>, to lock up or unlock the doore or entrance to all <i>America</i>.
Here rideth the King of <i>Spaines</i> Navy, and here meet all the Merchant ships from
severall ports and Havens of all those Countries afore-named, whether from the Islands
or from the Continent: in a word here commonly in the month of <i>September</i> is joyned
all the treasure as I may say of <i>America</i>, all the King of <i>Spains</i> revenews, with as much
more of Merchant goods, which the yeer that I was there were thought to be in all the
worth of thirty millions. And the ships which that yeer there did meet to strengthen
one another were 53. saile, and set out sooner that yeer then any other upon the 16.
of <i>September</i>, having that day a faire wind to wafte them homewards through the Gulf
of <i>Bahama. Havana</i> therefore being the store-house of all <i>Americaes</i> treasure, it hath
been the <i>Spaniards</i> chiefe care to fortifie that; and truely it is so strong, that the <i>Spaniards</i>
hold it impossible to be taken, and doe boast of foure impregnable forts, to wit at
<i>Antwerp, Millan, Pamplona</i>, and <i>Havana</i>. This hath two strong Castles, the one at
the point or entrance of the Haven toward the Sea; the other more within, on the other
side almost over against it; which two Castles (the passage in the mouth of the haven
being so narrow, that one onely ship in breast may enter) will keep and defend the
Port from many hundred saile. I was my selfe in the great and chiefe Castle, and truly
found it very strong, though by land I judged it might be as easily taken, as other strong
Castles here in <i>Europe</i> have been overpowerd by a great and powerfull army. It hath in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
it besides many others, twelve peeces of Ordnance of brasse exceeding great, which they
call The twelve Apostles. But for all this strength of the <i>Havana</i>, it could not once defend
six or seven millions (according to the <i>Spaniards</i> owne account) which the one
part of the Kings Navy brought from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to the sight of this impregnable
fort, and protected with such twelve Apostles. It was as I take it the yeer 1629.
when that ever renowned <i>Hollander</i> (whom like unto our <i>Drake</i> the <i>Spaniards</i> to this
day fear and tremble at, calling him <i>Pie de Palo</i>, that is, wooden leg) waited at the
Cape of <i>St. Anthony</i> for the <i>Spanish</i> fleet of <i>Nova Hispania</i>; which according to his expectation
coming, he manly set upon it, saluting and welcoming the great treasure in it
with a full side of roaring Ordnance; the sound was more dolefull then joyfull and
welcome to the <i>Spaniards</i>, who thought it safer sleeping in a whole skinne, then to be
unquieted by fighting, and with the sight of torne and mangled bodies, by <i>Mars</i> his
furious and fiery balls, and so called a Councell of warre to resolve what they should
doe to save the Kings great treasure which was intrusted to them in those ships. The result
of the Councell was to flie and with some discharging of their Ordinance to defend
themselves, untill they could put into a river in the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, not far from
<i>Havana</i> called <i>Matanzos</i>. There were in that fleet of <i>Spaine</i> many gallants and Gentlemen,
and two Judges of the Chancery of <i>Mexico</i>, which were that yeer sent to
<i>Madrid</i> as guilty in the mutiny before mentioned, there was in it of my acquaintance
a Dominican Frier, named Frier <i>Jacintho de Hozes</i>, who had been sent to those parts to
visit all the Dominican Cloisters of <i>New-Spaine</i>, and had got of bribes at least eight
thousand duckats (as I was informed the yeer after by a Frier his companion, whom he
sent from <i>Havana</i> to <i>Guatemala</i> to make knowne to his friends his losse of all that hee
had got, and to beg a new contribution to helpe him home) there was also in that fleet
<i>Don Martin de Carillo</i>; who was the Inquisitor and Commissioner to judge the Delinquents
in the fore-mentioned mutiny of <i>Mexico</i>, who was thought to have got twenty
thousand duckats cleer; besides these a Bishop, and many rich Merchants, all under
the command of <i>Don Juan de Guzman y Torres</i> Admirall to all the fleet. They all
fled for their lives and goods; but the gallant <i>Hollanders</i> chased them. The <i>Spaniards</i>
thinking the <i>Hollanders</i> would not venture up the river after them, put into <i>Matanzos</i>;
but soone after they had entred, they found the river too shallow for their heavy and
great bellied Galeons, and so run them up on ground; which done, the better and richer
sort escaped to land, endeavouring to escape with what wealth they could; some got
out Cabinets, some bags; which the <i>Hollanders</i> perceiving came upon them with bullet
messengers, which soone overtooke and stopt their flying treasures. Some few Cabinets
were hid, all the rest became that day the gallant <i>Pie de Palo</i> or the wooden legd
Captaines prize for the mighty States of <i>Holland</i>. The Frier <i>Hozes</i> was got into a boat
with his Cabinet under his habit, which had in it nothing but chaines of gold, diamonds,
Pearles and pretious stones; and halfe a dozen <i>Hollanders</i> leapt into the boat after
him, and snatched it from him, as his owne friend and companion related after to
us in <i>Guatemala. Don Juan de Guzman y Torres</i> the Admirall when he came to <i>Spaine</i>
was imprisoned, lost his wits for a while, and after was beheaded. Thus in the sight
of impregnable <i>Havana</i> and of those 12 brazen Apostles, was <i>Holland</i> glorious and
made rich with a seven million prize.</p>

<p>But before I end this Chapter, I may not forget the chiefest of all the Islands of this
new world, which is called <i>Hispaniola</i>, &amp; formerly by the natives <i>Hatie</i>, which lamenteth
the losse of at least three millions of <i>Indians</i> murthered by her new Masters of <i>Spaine</i>.
This Island is the biggest that as yet is discovered in al the world; it is in compasse about
1500. miles, and enjoyeth a temperate aire, a fertill soile, rich mines; and trades
much in Ambar, Sugar, Ginger, Hides, and Wax. It is reported for certaine that here
in twenty daies herbes will ripen and roots also and be fit to be eaten, which is a strong
argument of the exact temperature of the aire. It yeeldeth in nothing to <i>Cuba</i>, but
excelleth it in three things especially; first in the finenesse of the gold, which is here
more pure and unmixed; secondly, in the increase of the Sugar, one Sugar Cane here
filling twenty and sometimes thirty measures; and thirdly, in the goodnesse of the
soile for tillage, the corne here yeelding an hundred fold. This fertility is thought to
be caused by four great rivers, which water and enrich all the four quarters of the Island;
all four doe spring from one only mountaine, which standeth in the very midst
and center of the Country, <i>Juna</i> running to the East, <i>Artihinnacus</i> to the West, <i>Jacchus</i>
to the North, and <i>Naibus</i> to the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>This Countrey is so replenished with Swine and Cattell, that they become wild among
the woods and Mountaines, so that the ships that saile by this Island, and want
provision, goe here a shore where it is little inhabited and kill of Cattell, wild swine
and bores, till they have made up a plentifull provision. Much of this Countrey is not
inhabited, by reason that the <i>Indians</i> are quite consumed. The chief places in it are first
St. <i>Domingo</i>, where there is a <i>Spanish</i> President and Chancery with six Judges and the
other officers belonging to it, and it is the Seat of an Archbishop, who though hee
enjoy not so much yeerly rent and revenues as other Archbishops, especially they of
<i>Mexico</i> and <i>Lima</i>; yet hee hath an honour above all the rest, for that hee is the primate
of all the <i>India's</i>, this Island having been conquered before the other parts, and so
bearing antiquity above them all. There are also other rich Townes of trading, as
<i>Sta. Isabella, S. Thome, S. John, Maragna</i>, and <i>Porto</i>. And thus hath my pen run over
Sea and Land, Islands and most of the Continent that is subject to the <i>Spaniards</i> to
shew thee, my Reader, the state of <i>America</i> at this time. It is called <i>America</i> because
<i>Americus Vespusius</i> first discovered it; though afterwards <i>Columbus</i> gave us the first
light to discern these Countries both by example and directions. Besides the factions
spoken of before between the Native <i>Spaniards</i> and those that come from <i>Spain</i>, there
is yet further in most parts of it, but especially in <i>Peru</i> a deadly faction and mortall
hatred between the <i>Biscains</i> and the <i>Spaniards</i> of <i>Castile</i> and <i>Estremadura</i>, which hath
much shaken the quiet state of it, and threatned it with rebellion and destruction.</p>

<p>There are in all <i>America</i> foure Archbishopricks, which are <i>Sto. Domingo, Mexico,
Lima</i>, and <i>Sta. Fee</i>, and above thirty inferiour Bishops. The politick Administration
of Justice is chiefly committed to the two Viceroyes residing at <i>Lima</i> and <i>Mexico</i>, and
with subordination unto them unto other Presidents, Governours, and high Justices,
called <i>Alcaldes Majores</i>; except it be the President of <i>Guatemala</i>, and of <i>Santo Domingo</i>,
who are as absolute in power as the Viceroyes, and have under them Governours, and
high Justices, and are no wayes subordinate to the former Viceroyes, but onely unto the
Court and Councell of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<h4><i>Shewing my journey from</i> Mexico <i>to</i> Chiapa <i>Southward, and the most remarkable
places in the way.</i></h4>


<p>Having now gone round <i>America</i> with a brief and superficiall description of it,
my desire is to shew unto my Reader what parts of it I travailed through, and
did abide in, observing more particularly the state, condition, strength,
and Commodities of those Countries which lie Southward from <i>Mexico</i>.
It is further my desire, nay the chief ground of this my History, that whilst my Country
doth here observe an <i>English</i> man, become <i>American</i>, travailing many thousand miles
there, as may bee noted from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, and from thence Southward
to <i>Panama</i>, and from thence Northward againe to <i>Carthagena</i>, and to <i>Havana</i>, Gods
goodnesse may bee admired, and his providence extolled who suffered not the meanest
and unworthiest of all his Creatures to perish in such unknowne Countries; to be swalled
by North or South Sea, where shipwracks were often feared; to bee lost in Wildernesses
where no tongue could give directions; to bee devoured by Wolves, Lions, Tigers,
or Crocodiles, which there so much abound; to fall from steepy rocks and mountaines,
which seeme to dwell in the aereall Region, and threaten with fearefull spectacles
of deep and profound precipices, a horrid and inevitable death to those that climbe
up to them; to bee eaten up by the greedy Earth which there doth often quake and
tremble, and hath sometimes opened her mouth to draw in Townes and Cities; to
bee stricken with those fiery darts of Heaven and thunderbolts which in winter season
threaten the Rockes and Cedars; to bee inchanted by Satans Instruments, Witches
and Sorcerers, who there as on their own ground play their prankes more then in the
parts of Christendome; to be quite blinded with <i>Romish</i> Errors and Superstitions,
which have double blinded the purblind heathenish Idolaters; to bee wedded to the pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and licentiousnesse, which doe there allure; to bee glutted with the plenty and dainties
of fish, flesh, fowles, and fruits, which doe there entice; to bee puffed up with
the spirit of pride and powerfull command and authority over the poor <i>Indians</i>, which
doth there provoke; to bee tied with the Cords of vanity and ambition, which there
are strong; and finally to be glewed in heart, and affection to the drosse of gold, silver,
Pearls, and Jewels, whose plenty there doth bind, blind, captivate and enslave the soule.
Oh I say, let the Lords great goodnesse and wonderfull providence bee observed who
suffered not an <i>English</i> stranger in all these dangers to miscarry, but was a guide unto
him there in all his travailes, discovered unto him as to the espies in <i>Canaan</i>, and as
to <i>Joseph</i> in <i>Egypt</i> the provision, wealth and riches of that world, and safely guided
him back to relate to <i>England</i>, the truth of what no other <i>English</i> eye did ever yet behold.
From the moneth of <i>October</i> untill <i>February</i> I did abide with my friends, and
companions the Fryers under the command of Fryer <i>Calvo</i> in that house of recreation
called St. <i>Jacintho</i>, and from thence injoyed the sight of all the Townes and of what
else was worth the seeing about <i>Mexico</i>. But the time I was there, I was carefull to
informe myself of the state of <i>Philippinas</i>, whither my first purposes had drawne me
from <i>Spain</i>. It was my fortune to light upon a Fryer and an acquaintance of some of
my friends, who was that yeer newly come from <i>Manila</i> whither I was going; who
wished mee and some other of my friends as wee tendred our soules good never to goe
to those parts, which were but snares and trap-dores to let downe to hell, where occasions
and temptations to sinne were daily, many in number, mighty in strength, and
to get out of them, <i>labor &amp; opus</i>, hard and difficult. And that himself, had not he by
stealth gotten away (and that to save his soul) certainly he had never come from thence;
who had often upon his knees begged leave of his superiours to returne to <i>Spain</i>, and
could not obtaine it. Many particulars wee could not get from him, nor the reasons
of his coming away; Onely hee would often say that the Fryers that live there
are devils in private and in those retired places where they live among the <i>Indians</i> to
instruct and teach them; and yet in publick before their superiours and the rest of Fryers
they must appeare Saints, they must put on the cloak of hypocrisie to cover their
inward devilishnesse, they must bee cloathed with sheeps skins though within they bee
<i>lupi rapaces</i>, ravenous Wolves, ravening after their neighbours Wives, and ravening after
their neighbours wealth; and yet with all this unpreparednesse, with this outward,
seeming and frothy sanctity, and inward hellishnesse and deep rooted worldlinesse
and covetousnesse, when the Superiours command and please to send them, they
must goe in a disguised manner to <i>Japan</i> or <i>China</i> to convert to Christianity those people
though with perill and danger of their lives. Many such like discourses wee got
out of this Fryer; and that if wee went to live there, we must bee subject to the penalties
of many Excommunications for triviall toyes and trifles, which the Superiours
doe lay upon the Consciences of their poore Subjects, who may as soone strive against
the common course of nature not to see with their eyes, nor hear with their eares, nor
speake with their tongues, as to observe all those things which against sense, reason
and nature with grievous censures and Excommunications are charged and fastened upon
them. Hee told us further of some Fryers that had despaired under those rigorous
courses, and hanged themselves, not being able to beare the burden of an afflicted and
tormented Conscience; and of others that had been hanged, some for murthering of
their rigid and cruell Superiours; and some that had beene found in the morning
hanging with their queanes at the Cloister gates, having beene found together in the
night, and so murthered and hanged up either by the true Husband, or by some other
who bare affection to the woman. These things seemed to us very strange, and
wee perceived that all was not gold that glistred, nor true zeal of soules that carried
so many from <i>Spain</i> to those parts; or if in some there were at first a better and truer
zeale then in others, when they came to <i>Philippinas</i>, and among those strong temptations,
wee found that their zeale was soone quenched. This reason moved mee and
three more of my friends to relent in our purposes of leaving of <i>America</i>, and going
any further, for wee had learned that <i>maxime, qui amat periculum, peribit inco</i>; and,
<i>qui tangit picem, inquinabitur abea</i>; He that loveth the danger, shall fall and perish in it;
and hee that toucheth pitch shall bee smeared by it. Wherefore wee communed
privately with our selves, what course wee might take, how wee might that yeer return
back to <i>Spain</i>, or where wee might abide, if wee returned not to <i>Spain</i>. For wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
knew, if our Superiour <i>Calvo</i> should understand of our purposes to goe no further, he
would lay upon us an Excommunication to follow him, nay and that hee would secure us
in a Cloister prison untill the day and time of our departure from <i>Mexico</i>. Our resolutions
wee made a secret of our hearts; yet could not I but impart it to one more
speciall and intimate friend of mine, who was an <i>Irish</i> Fryer, named <i>Thomas de Leon</i>,
whom I perceived a little troubled with so long a journey as was at hand, and found
often wishing hee had never come from <i>Spain</i>; and as soon as I had acquainted him
with what I meant to doe, hee rejoyced and promised to stay with mee. The time
was short which wee had to dispose of our selves; but in that time wee addressed our
selves to some <i>Mexican</i> Fryers and made knowne unto them, that if our Superiour
<i>Calvo</i> would give us leave, wee would willingly stay in <i>Mexico</i> or in any Cloister thereabouts,
untill wee could better fit our selves to returne to <i>Spain</i> againe. But they being
natives and borne in that Countrey discovered presently unto us that inveterate
spight and hatred which they bare to such as came from <i>Spain</i>; they told us plainly
that they and true <i>Spaniards</i> born did never agree, and that they knew their Superiors
would bee unwilling to admit of us; yet furthermore they informed us that they
thought we might be entertained in the Province of <i>Guaxaca</i>, where half the Fryers were
of <i>Spain</i> and half Criolians and Natives; but in case wee should not speed there, they
would warrant us we should be welcome to the Province of <i>Guatemala</i>, where almost all
the Fryers were of <i>Spain</i>, and did keep under such as were Natives born in that Country.
It did a little trouble us to consider that <i>Guatemala</i> was three hundred leagues off, and
that we were ignorant of the <i>Mexican</i> tongue, and unprovided of mony and horses for
so long a journey. But yet we considered <i>Philippinas</i> to be further, and no hopes there of
returning ever again to Christendome; wherefore we resolved to rely upon Gods providence
onely, and to venture upon a three hundred leagues journey with what smal means
we had, and to sell what Books and small trifles we had to make as much money as might
buy each of us a horse. But while we were thus preparing our selves secretly for <i>Guatemala</i>
wee were affrighted and disheartned with what in the like case to ours happened.
A Fryer of our company named Fryer <i>Peter Borrallo</i>, without acquainting us or any other
of his friends with what he intended, made a secret escape from us, and (as after we
were informed) took his way alone to <i>Guatemala</i>. This so incensed our Superior <i>Calvo</i>,
that after great search and enquiry after him, he betook himself to the Viceroy begging
his assistance and Proclamation, in the publick Market place, for the better finding out
his lost sheep, and alleadging that none ought to hide or privily to harbour any
Fryer that had been sent from <i>Spain</i> to <i>Philippinas</i> to preach there the Gospell, for that
the foresaid Fryers were sent by the King of <i>Spain</i>, whose bread they had eate, and
at whose charges they had been brought from <i>Spain</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, and at the same Kings
charges ought to bee carried from <i>Mexico</i> to <i>Philippinas</i>; and therefore if any Fryer
now in the half-way should recant of his purpose of going to <i>Philippinas</i>, and should
by flight escape from his Superiour and the rest of his company, the same ought to be
punished as guilty of defrauding the Kings charges. This reason of <i>Calvo</i> being a
politicke and state reason prevailed so farre with the Viceroy, that immediately hee
commanded a Proclamation to bee made against whosoever should know of the said
<i>Peter Borrallo</i> and should not produce him to his Highnesse, or should harbour him or
any other Fryer belonging to <i>Philippinas</i> from that time forward until the ships were
departed from <i>Acapulco</i>; and that whosoever should trespasse against this Proclamation,
should suffer imprisonment at his Highnesse his will and and pleasure, and the
penalty of five hundred Duckats to bee paid in at the Kings Exchequer. With this
Proclamation <i>Calvo</i> began to insult over us, and to tell us, wee were the Kings slaves
under his conduct, and that if any of us durst to leave him (for hee was jealous of
most of us) hee doubted not but with the Viceroy his assistance and Proclamation he
should find both us and <i>Peter Borrallo</i> out to our further shame and confusion. This did
very much trouble us, and made my <i>Irish</i> friend <i>Thomas de Leon</i> his heart to faint, and
his courage to relent, and utterly to renounce before mee his former purposes of staying
and hiding himselfe; yet hee protested to mee, if I was still of the same minde,
hee would not discover mee; but seeing his weaknesse, I durst not trust him, but made
as if I were of his minde. Thus I betooke my self to the other three of my friends (of
whom one was <i>Antonio Melendez</i> that had beene the first cause of my comming from
<i>Spain</i>) whom I found much troubled, doubtfull and wavering what course to take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>They considered if wee should flie, what a shame it would be to us to be taken and
brought back to <i>Mexico</i> as prisoners, and forcedly against our wills to be shipped to <i>Philippinas</i>;
they considered further if they went, what a slavish and uncomfortable life they
should live in <i>Philippinas</i>, without any hopes of ever returning again to Christendom;
yet further they looked upon the Viceroy his Proclamation, and thought it hard to
breake through the opposition and authority of so great a man; and lastly in the Proclamation
they beheld the estimation that <i>Calvo</i> had of them, as of slaves and fugitives
to be cried in a publike Market place. But after all these serious thoughts our
only comfort was that <i>Peter Borallo</i> was safely escaped, and (as we were informed) had
been met farre from <i>Mexico</i> travailing alone towards <i>Guatemala</i>. And we thought, why
might not we escape as well as he. Then I told them that my resolution was to stay,
though alone I returned either to <i>Spaine</i>, or tooke my journey to <i>Guatemala</i>; the rest
were glad to see mee resolute, and gave their hands that they would venture as much as I
should. Then we set upon the time when we should take our flight, and agreed that every
one should have a Horse in readinesse in <i>Mexico</i>, and that the night before the rest of
our company should depart from <i>Mexico</i> towards <i>Acapulco</i> to take shipping, we should
by two and two in the evening leave <i>St. Jacintho</i>, and meet in <i>Mexico</i> where our Horses
stood, and from thence set out and travaile all the night, continuing our journey so
the first two or three nights and resting in the day time, untill we were some twenty
or thirty leagues from <i>Mexico</i>. For we thought the next morning <i>Calvo</i> awaking and
missing us would not stop the journey of the rest of his company for our sakes, to
search and inquire after us; or if he did, it would be but for one day or two at the
most, till he had inquired for us in <i>Mexico</i>, or a dayes journey in some of the common
or beaten rodes of <i>Mexico</i>, where we would be sure he should not heare of us; for we
also agreed to travail out of any common or knowne rode for the first two or three
nights. This resolution was by us as well performed and carried on, as it had been agreed
upon, though some had been fearfull that a counsell betwixt foure could never be
kept secret, nor such a long journey as of nine hundred miles be compassed with such
small means of money as was among us, for the maintenance of our selves and Horses;
for after our Horses were bought, we made a common purse, and appointed one to be the
purse-bearer, &amp; found that amongst us all there were but twenty duckats, which in that
rich and plentifull country was not much more then here twenty <i>English</i> shillings, which
seemed to us but as a morning dew, which would soone be spent in provender only for
our Horses; yet we resolved to goe on, relying more upon the providence of God, then
upon any earthly meanes; and indeed this proved to us a far better support then all the
drosse of gold and silver could have done; and we reckoned that after we had
travailed fourty leagues from <i>Mexico</i>, and entred without feare into the rode, we had
for our twenty duckats neer fourty now in our common purse. The reason was, for
that most commonly we went either to Friers Cloisters who knew us not, or to rich
farmes of <i>Spaniards</i> who thought nothing too good for us, and would not onely entertaine
us stately, but at our departure would give us money for one or two daies journey.
All our feare was to get safely out of <i>Mexico</i>, for wee had been informed that
<i>Calvo</i> had obtained from the Viceroy officers to watch in the chiefest rodes both day
and night untill he had departed with his Traine of Friers to <i>Acapulco</i>.</p>

<p>And for all the Viceroy his Proclamation we got a true and trustie friend, who offered
to guide us out of <i>Mexico</i> by such a way as we needed not to feare any would watch
for us. So with our friend and a map about us to guide us after he had left us in the morning,
we cheerfully set out of <i>Mexico</i> about ten of the clock at night, about the middle
of <i>February</i>, and meeting no body about <i>Guadalupe</i> which was the way wee went out
(though the contrary way to <i>Guatemala</i>, which on purpose we followed for feare the
true way should be beset) we comfortably travailed all that night, till in the morning we
came to a little Town of <i>Indians</i>, where we began to spend of our small stock, calling upon
the <i>Indians</i> for a Turkey and Capon to break our fast with our friend and guide before
he returned to <i>Mexico</i>. Breakefast being ended we took our leaves of him, and went
to rest, that we might be more able to performe the next nights journey, which was to
Crosse the Countrey towards <i>Atlisco</i>, which is in a valley of twenty miles about at
least, and doth give it the name of the valley of <i>Atlixco</i> and is a valley much mentioned
in all those parts, for the exceeding great plenty of wheat that is there reaped every yeer,
and is the chief sustenance and reliefe of <i>Mexico</i> and all the Townes about. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Valley are many rich Townes of <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>; but we shunned to enter into
them, and went from farme to farme out of the high-waies, where we found good
entertainment of those rich Farmers and Yeomen, who bare such respect unto the
Preists, that truely they thought themselves happy with our company. Here we began
to shake off all fear, and no more like Bats and Owles fly in the night, but
that we might with more pleasure enjoy the prospect of that valley, and of the rest of the
Countrey we travailed by day; yet still crossing the Countrey, we went from thence towards
another valley called the valley of <i>St. Pablo</i>, or <i>Pauls</i> valley, which though it be not
as big as the valley of <i>Atlisco</i>, yet is held to be a richer valley; for here they enjoy a double
harvest of wheat every yeer. The first seed they sow is watered, and growes with the common
season raine; and the second seed which they sow in summer as soone as their
first harvest is in, when the season of raine is past, they water with many Springs which
fall into that Valley from the mountaines which round beset it, and let in the water
among their wheat at their pleasure, and take it away when they see fit. Here live Yeomen
upon nothing but their farms, who are judged to worth some twenty thousand,
some thirty thousand, some fourty thousand duckats. In this valley we chanced to
light upon one farme where the Yeoman was country-man to my friend <i>Antonio Melendez</i>,
borne in <i>Segovia</i> in <i>Spaine</i>, who for his sake kept us three daies and nights with
him. His table was as well furnished as the table of a Knight might be, his side board full
of silver boules and cups, and plates instead of trenchers; he spared no dainties which
might welcome us to his table, no perfumes which might us delight in our chambers, no
musick (which his daughters were brought up to) which might with more pleasure help
to passe away the time. To him <i>Antonio Melendez</i> made known our journey towards <i>Guatemala</i>;
and from him we received directions which way to steere our course untill we
might be thoroughly free from feare and danger; here we began to see the great providence
of God, who had brought us being strangers to such a friends house, who not
onely welcomed us to him, but when we departed gave us a guide for a whole day, and
bestowed upon us twenty duckats to helpe to bear our charges. From this valley wee
wheeled about to <i>Tasco</i>, a Towne of some five hundred Inhabitants which enjoyeth
great commerce with the Country about by reason of the great store of Cotton-wool
which is there. And here we were very well entertained by a Franciscan Frier, who
being of <i>Spaine</i> made the more of us, knowing we came from thence. Here we got into
the rode of <i>Guaxaca</i>, and went to <i>Chautla</i>, which also aboundeth with Cotton-wool,
but in it we found no entertainment but what our owne purses would afford us.
Next to this place is a great Town called <i>Zumpango</i>, which doth consist of at least eight
hundred Inhabitants, many of them very rich both <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>. Their
commodities are chiefly Cotton-wooll, and Sugar, and Cochinil. But beyond this
Town are the mountaines called <i>la Misteca</i>, which abound with many rich and great
Townes, and doe trade with the best silke that is in all that Country. Here is also great
store of Wax and Hony; and <i>Indians</i> live there who traffique to <i>Mexico</i> and about the
Countrey with twenty or thirty mules of their own, chopping and changing, buying
and selling commodities, and some of them are thought to be worth ten, or twelve, or
fifteen thousand duckats, which is much for an <i>Indian</i> to get among the <i>Spaniards</i>, who
thinke all the riches of <i>America</i> little enough for themselves. From these mountaines
of <i>Misteca</i> to <i>Guaxaca</i> we saw little observable, only Townes of two or three hundred
inhabitants; rich Churches, well built, and better furnished within with lampes, candlesticks,
crownes of silver for the severall statues of Saints; and all the way wee did
observe a very fruitfull soil for both <i>Indian</i> and <i>Spanish</i> wheat, much Sugar, much Cotton-wool,
Hony, and here and there some Cochinil, and of Plantins, and other
sweet and luscious fruit great store; but above all great abundance of cattel, whose Hides
are one of the greatest commodities that from those parts are sent to <i>Spaine</i>. Some reported
that about <i>Misteca</i> formerly much gold had been found, and the <i>Indians</i> were
wont to use it much, though now they will not be knowne of any, lest the greedinesse
of the <i>Spaniards</i> bring them to misery and destruction, as it hath their neighbours about
them. Also it is reported for certaine that there are Mines of silver, though as
yet the <i>Spaniards</i> have not found them.</p>

<p>There are many Mines of Iron which the <i>Spaniards</i> will not busie themselves in digging,
because they have it cheaper from <i>Spain</i>; from hence wee came to the City of
<i>Guaxaca</i>, which is a Bishops Seat, though not very bigge, yet a faire and beautifull City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to behold. It standeth fourescore leagues from <i>Mexico</i> in a pleasant valley from whence
<i>Cortez</i> was named <i>Marques del Valle</i>, the Marquesse of the Valley. This City, as all the rest
of <i>America</i>, except the Sea Towns, lyeth open without walls, Bulwarkes, Forts, Towers,
or any Castle, Ordnance or Ammunition to defend it. It may consist of at the most
two thousand Inhabitants, and are governed by a <i>Spanish</i> High Justice called <i>Alcalde
Major</i>, whose power reacheth over all the Valley, and beyond it as farre as <i>Nixapa</i>,
and almost to <i>Tecoantepeque</i>, a Sea Towne upon <i>Mar del Zur</i>. The Valley is of at least
fifteen miles in length, and ten in breadth, where runneth in the midst a goodly River
yeelding great store of fish. The Valley is full of Sheep and other Cattell, which yeeld
much Wooll to the Clothiers of the City of <i>Angels</i>, store of Hides to the Merchants of
<i>Spain</i>, and great provision of flesh to the City of <i>Guaxaca</i>, and to all the Townes about,
which are exceeding rich, and doe maintaine many Cloisters of Fryers, and Churches
with stately furniture belonging unto them. But what doth make the Valley of
<i>Guaxaca</i> to bee mentioned farre and neer, are the good horses which are bred in it, and
esteemed to bee the best of all the Country. In this Valley also are some farmes of
Sugar, and great store of fruits, which two sorts meeting together have cried up the
City of <i>Guaxaca</i> for the best Conserves and Preserves that are made in <i>America</i>. In
the City there are some six Cloisters of Nuns and Fryers, all of them exceeding
rich; but above all is the Cloister of the Dominican Fryers, whose Church treasure
is worth two or three Millions; and the building of it the fairest and strongest in all
those parts, the walls are of stone so broad, that a part of them being upon finishing
when I was there I saw Carts goe upon them, with stone and other materials. Here
are also two Cloisters of Nuns, which are talked of far and neer not for their religious
practices, but for their skill in making two drinkes which are used in those parts, the
one called <i>Chocolatte</i> (whereof I shall speake heereafter) and the other <i>Atolle</i>, which
is like unto our <i>Almond</i> Milk, but much thicker, and is made of the juyce of the yong
<i>Maiz</i> or <i>Indian</i> wheat, which they so confection with spices, musk, and sugar, that
it is not onely admirable in the sweetnesse of the smell, but much more nourishing and
comforting the stomack. This is not a Commoditie that can bee transported from
thence, but is to be drunk there where it is made. But the other, <i>Chocolatte</i>, is made up
in Boxes, and sent not onely to <i>Mexico</i> and the parts thereabouts, but much of it is
yeerly transported into <i>Spain</i>. This City of <i>Guaxaca</i> is the richer by reason of the safety
they enjoy for the carriage of their Commodities to and from the port of St. <i>John de
Ulhua</i> by the great River <i>Alvarado</i> which runneth not far from it; and although the
Barkes come not to the City of <i>Guaxaca</i>, yet they come up to the <i>Zapotecas</i>, and to St.
<i>Ildefonso</i>, which is not farre from <i>Guaxaca</i>. And the carelessenesse of the <i>Spaniards</i>
here is to be wondred at, that all along this River which runneth up into the heart of
their Country, they have built as yet no Castles, Towers, or watch-houses, or planted
any Ordinance, trusting onely in this, that great ships cannot come up, as if Frigots
or smaller Barks, such as they themselves use, may not bee made to annoy them. But
of <i>Guaxaca</i> I shall say no more, but conclude that it is of so temperate an aire, so abounding
in fruits, and all provision requisite for mans life, so commodiously situated
between the North and South Sea, having on the North side St. <i>John de Ulhua</i>, and
on the South <i>Tecoantepeque</i> a small and unfortified harbour, that no place I so much
desired to live in whilest I was in those parts as in <i>Guaxaca</i>, which certainly I had
attempted as I travailed by it, had I not understood that the Criolian or Native
Fryers were many and as deadly enemies unto those that came from <i>Spain</i> as were the
<i>Mexicans</i>. And this their spight and malice they shewed whilest wee were there, to
an ancient and grave old Fryer Master in Divinity, who living had been for learning
the Oracle of those parts. This old man died when I was there, and because when
hee lived they could pick no hole in his Coat, being dead they searched his chamber,
and finding in a Coffer some moneys which hee had not made knowne to his Superiour
when living (which they would reduce to a sinne against his professed poverty,
called Propriety, and subject to the censure of Excommunication) they reported
that hee had died excommunicated, and might not injoy their Christian buriall in
the Church or Cloister, and so ignominiously buried their old Divine, and with him
his Credit and reputation in a grave made in one of their Gardens. A thing much talked on
as scandalous to all the City and Country, which they salved with saying hee was excommunicated;
but the truth was, he was of <i>Spaine</i>, and therefore at his death they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
would shew their spight unto him. For certainly they could not doe it for the sinne of
Propriety which by him had been committed in his life; and to them all may be well
said what our Saviour said to the Jewes bringing to him a woman found in adultery
to bee stoned, Whosoever of you is without sinne, let him cast the first stone; for all
of them, yea even the best Fryers that live in <i>America</i>, are some way or other, much or
lesse guilty of the sinne of Propriety which they professe and vow against. With
this which wee saw with our eyes, besides what with our eares wee had heard of discords
and factions amongst them, wee thought <i>Guaxaca</i> was no place for us to live in;
so after three dales we made haste out of it, and departed towards <i>Chiapa</i>, which lyeth
three hundred miles from thence. And for our comfort in our further travailing we were
informed in <i>Guaxaca</i>, that in most Towns of the Rode through that country, the <i>Indians</i>
had an order from the High Justice to give unto Fryers travailing that way either
horse to ride on, or to carry their carriages and provision of food freely without
mony, if they had none, so that at their departure they should write it down in the town
booke what they had spent, not abiding above foure and twenty houres in the Town;
which expences of travailers the <i>Indians</i> afterwards at the yeers end of their ordinary
Justice and Officers were to give an account of with carrying their Towne book unto
the <i>Spanish</i> justice to whom they belonged, and by so doing these expences were allowed
of to bee discharged by the common Towne Purse or Treasure, for the which
a common plot of ground was alloted to bee yeerly sowen with wheat or <i>Maiz</i>.
With this charitable relief and help of the Townes wee conceived better of the rest
of our long journey, and hoped to compasse it with more ease. And so joyfully we
went on, and the first place where wee made triall of this order was at a great Town
called <i>Antiquera</i>, where wee freely called for our fowles and what other provision we
saw in the Town, fed heartily on them, and the next day when we were to pay and
to depart, wee called for the Town book, subscribed our hands to what wee had
spent ourselves and horses, and went our way, praising the discretion of the Justices
of that Country, who had setled a course so easy and comfortable for us, especially
who had but shallow purses for our long journy. Yet we found in some small Towns
that the <i>Indians</i> were unwilling, and (as they alleadged) unable to extend this Charity
to us, being foure in company, and bringing with us the charge likewise of foure
horses, which made us sometimes make the longer journey that wee might reach unto
some great and rich Towne. The next to <i>Antiquera</i> in that Rode is <i>Nixapa</i>, which
is of at the least eight hundred Inhabitans, <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>, standing upon the side
of a River, which wee were informed was an arme of the great River <i>Alvarado</i>. In
this Town is a very rich Cloister of Dominican Fryers, where we were well entertained;
&amp; in it there is a picture of our Lady, which superstitiously they fancy to have wrought
miracles, and is made a pilgrimage from far and neere, and consequently hath great
riches and Lampes belonging unto it. This is counted absolutely one of the wealthiest
places of all the Countrey of <i>Guaxaca</i>; for here is made much Indigo, Sugar, <i>Cochinill</i>;
and here grow many trees of <i>Cacao</i> and <i>Achiotte</i>, whereof is made the <i>Chocolatte</i>,
and is a commodity of much trading in those parts, though our <i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i>
make little of it when they take a prize of it at Sea, as not knowing the secret virtue
and quallity of it for the good of the stomack. From hence we went to <i>Aguatulco</i> and
<i>Capalita</i>, also great Towns standing upon a plain Country full of Sheep and Cattell, abounding
with excellent fruits, especially <i>Pines</i> and <i>Sandia's</i>, which are as big as Pumpions,
and so waterish that they even melt like snow in the mouth, &amp; cool the heat which
there is great, by reason it is a low and Marsh kind of ground, lying neer the South Sea.
The next chief Town and most considerable after <i>Capalita</i> is <i>Tecoantepeque</i>; this is a Sea
Town upon <i>Mar del Zur</i>, and a harbour for small vessels, such as Trade from those parts
to <i>Acapulco</i> and <i>Mexico</i>, and to <i>Realejo</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>, and sometimes to <i>Panama</i>. Here
upon some occasions Ships which come from <i>Peru</i> to <i>Acapulco</i> doe call in. It is a port
no farther safe, then that no <i>English</i> or <i>Holland</i> Ships doe come thereabouts, which if
they did, they would there find no resistance, but from thence would finde an open and
easie Rode over all the Countrey. Upon all this South Sea side from <i>Acapulco</i> to <i>Panama</i>,
which is above two thousand miles by land there is no open harbour, but this
for <i>Guaxaca</i>, and <i>La Trinidad</i> for <i>Guatemala</i>, and <i>Realejo</i> for <i>Nicaragua</i>, and <i>Golfo
de Salinas</i> for small vessels in <i>Costa Rica</i>, and all these unprovided of Ordnance and
Ammunition, all open dores to let in any Nation that would take the pains to surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the World to get a treasure. This port of <i>Tecoantepeque</i> is the chiefe for fishing
in all that Countrey; wee met here in the wayes sometimes with fifty, sometimes
with a hundred mules together laden with nothing but salt fish for <i>Guaxaca</i>,
City of the <i>Angels</i> and <i>Mexico</i>. There are some very rich Merchants dwell in
it, who trade with <i>Mexico, Peru</i> and <i>Philippinas</i>, sending their small vessels out from
Port to Port, which come home richly laden with the Commodities of all the
Southerne or Easterne parts. From hence to <i>Guatemala</i> there is a plaine Rode along
the Coast of the South Sea, passing through the Provinces of <i>Soconuzco</i> and <i>Suchutepeques</i>;
but wee aiming at <i>Chiapa</i> tooke our journey over the high Rocks and Mountaines
called <i>Quelenes</i>, travailing first from <i>Tecoantepeque</i> to <i>Estepeque</i>, and from thence
through a desert of two dayes journey, where wee were faine to lodge one night by a
spring of water upon the bare ground in open wide fields, where neither Town nor house
is to bee seene, yet thatcht lodges are purposely made for travailers. This plain lyeth
so open to the Sea, that the wind from thence blow so strongly and violently that travailers
are scarce able to sit their horses and mules; which is the reason no people inhabit
there, because the windes teare their houses, and the least fire that there breaks out,
doth a great deale of mischief. This plaine yet is full of Cattell, and Horses
and Mares, some wild, some tame; and through this windy Champaigne Country
with much adoe we travailed; though my self thought I should even there end my daies,
for the second day being to reach to a Towne, and my three friends riding before,
thinking that I followed them, evening now drawing on they made more hast to find
the Town. But in the meane while my horse refused to goe any further, threatning
to lie downe if I put him to more then hee was able. I knew the towne could not be
far, and so I lighted, thinking to walke and lead my horse, who also refused to bee
led, and so lay downe. With this a troop of thoughts beset mee, and to none I could
give a flat answer. I thought if I should goe on foot to finde out the Towne and my
company and leave my horse there sadled, I might both lose my selfe, and my horse
and saddle; and if I should find the Towne and come in the morning for my horse, the
plain was so wide and spatious, that I might seeke long enough, and neither finde him,
nor know the place where I left him, for there was nothing neere to marke the place,
nor where to hide the saddle, neither hedge, tree, shrub, within a mile on any side. Wherefore
I considered my best course would bee to take up my lodging in the wide and open
wildernesse with my horse, and to watch him lest hee should wander and stray away,
untill the morning or untill my friends might send from the towne to see what
was become of mee; which they did not that night, thinking I had taken my way to
another Town not far from thence, whither they sent in the morning to enquire for me.
I looked about therefore for a commodious place to rest in, but found no choice of lodgings,
everywhere I found a bed ready for mee, which was the bare ground; a bolster
onely or pillow I wanted for my head, and seeing no bank did kindly offer it selfe
to ease a lost stranger, and pilgrime, I unsadled my weary Jade, and with my saddle
fitted my head in stead of a pillow. Thus without a supper I went to bed in my Mothers
owne bosome, not a little comforted to see my tired horse pluck up his spirits, and
make much of his supper, which there was ready for him, of short, dry and withered
grasse, upon which hee fed with a greedy and hungry stomack, promising mee by his
feeding that the next day he would performe a journey of at least thirty or forty miles.
The poor Beast fed apace, my careful eye watched him for at least an houre, when upon a
suddain I heard such an hideous noise of howling, barking, and crying, as if a whole Army
of dogs were come into the wildernesse, and howled for want of a prey of some
dead horse or mule. At first the noise seemed to be a pretty way off from mee; but the
more I hearkened unto it, the nigher it came unto mee, and I perceived it was not of
dogs by some intermixt shriekings as of Christians, which I observed in it. An observation
too sad for alone man without any helpe or comfort in a wildernesse, which
made my haire to stand upright, my heart to pant, my body to bee covered with a fearfull
sweat as of death. I expected nothing else, not knowing from whence the noise
proceeded; sometimes I thought of Witches, sometimes of devils, sometimes of <i>Indians</i>
turned into the shape of beasts, (which amongst some hath beene used) sometimes
of wild and savage beasts, and from all these thoughts I promised my self nothing but
sure death, for the which I prepared my selfe recommending my soule to the Lord,
whilst I expected my body should bee a prey to cruell and mercilesse beasts; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
some instruments of that roaring Lion who in the Apostle goeth about seeking whom
he may devoure. I thought I could not any waies prevaile by flying or running away,
but rather might that way runne my selfe into the jawes of death; to hide there was
no place, to lie still I thought was safest, for if they were wild beasts, they might follow
their course another way from mee, and so I might escape. Which truly proved
my safest course, for while I lay sweating and panting, judging every cry, every howling
and shrieking an alarm to my death, being in this agony and fearfull conflict till
about midnight, on a suddain the noise ceased, sleep (though but the shadow of death)
seized upon my wearied body, and forsook me not, til the mornings glorious lamp shining
before my slumbering eies and driving away deaths shadow greeted me with life &amp;
safety. When I awaked, my soul did magnifie the Lord for my deliverance from that
nights danger, I looked about &amp; saw my horse also neer the place where I had left
him, I sadled him presently with desire to leave that wildernesse and to find out my company,
and to impart unto them what that night had happened unto mee; I had not rid
above a mile, when I came to a brook of water, where were two waies, the one straight
forward along the desart, where I could discover no Towne, nor houses, nor trees in a
prospect of five or six miles at least; the other way was on the left hand, and that
way some two or three miles off I saw a wood of trees, I imagined there might be the
Towne; I followed that way, and within a quarter of a mile my Horse beganne to
complaine of his poore provender the night before, and to slight me for it; I was fain
to light and lead him; and thus againe discouraged with my Horse, and discomforted
for the uncertainty of my way, looking about I spied a thatcht house on the one side
of the way, and one on Horse-back, who came riding to mee; it was an <i>Indian</i> belonging
to that house which was the farme of a rich <i>Indian</i>, and Governour of the
next Towne, of whom I asked how farre it was to the Town of <i>Estepeque</i>, he shewed
me the trees, and told me that a little beyond them it stood, and that I should not see it
untill I came unto it. With this I got up againe and spurred my sullen jade, untill I
reached unto the trees, where he was at a stand and would goe no further. Then I unsadled
him, and hid my saddle under some low shrubs, and leaving my horse (whom
I feared not that any would steale him) I walked unto the Towne which was not above
halfe a mile from thence, where I found my three friends were waiting for me, and
grieved for the losse of me, had sent to another Towne to enquire for me; it was the
least thought they had that I had been a lodger in the desart. When I related unto them
and to the <i>Indians</i> the noise and howling that I had heard, the <i>Indians</i> answered me that
that was common musick to them almost every night, &amp; that they were Wolves and Tigres
which they feared not, but did often meet them and with a sticke or hollowing did
scare them away, and that they were onely ravenous for their Fowles, Colts, Calves
or Kids. After a little discourse I returned with an <i>Indian</i> to seeke my Horse and saddle,
and in that Towne I sould my wearied <i>Mexican</i> beast, and hired another to <i>Ecatepeque</i>
whither we went all four friends again in company. Where note that in this plain
and champaigne country of <i>Tecoantepeque</i> are five rich and pleasant Townes full of
fruits and provision of victuall, all ending in <i>Tepeque</i>, to wit, <i>Tecoantepeque, Estepeque,
Ecatepeque, Sanatepeque</i>, and <i>Tapanatepeque</i>. Now from <i>Ecatepeque</i> wee could discover
the high mountaines of <i>Quelenes</i>, which were the subject of most of our discourse to
<i>Sanatepeque</i>, and from thence to <i>Tapanatepeque</i>. For we had been informed by <i>Spaniards</i>
and Travailers in the way, that they were the most dangerous mountains to travail over
that were in all those parts; and that there were on the top of them some passages so
narrow, and so high, and so open to the boisterous winds that came from the South-sea,
which seemed to lie at the very bottom of them; and on each side of these narrow
passages such deep precipices among rocks, that many times it had happened, that the
wind blowing furiously had cast downe Mules laden with heavy carriages downe the
rockes, and likewise Horse-men had been blown down both Horse and man. The sight
of the rockes and mountaines did terrifie us, and the report of them did much affright
us; so that in all this way we did conferre which way to take, whether the rode way to
<i>Guatemala</i> which lieth under those mountaines along the coast by the Country of <i>Soconuzco</i>,
from whence (though out of our way) we might have turned to <i>Chiapa</i>, or whether
we should steer our right course to <i>Chiapa</i> over those mountains, which we had been
informed, we might safely passe over if the winds did not blow too boisterously. We
resolved that when wee came to <i>Tapanatepeque</i> we would choose our way according as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the winds did favour or threaten us, but however to <i>Chiapa</i> we would goe, because there
we had understood was the Superiour and Provinciall or all the Dominicans of those
parts, (to whom we ought to addresse our selves) and also because we would see that
famous and much talked of Province of <i>Chiapa</i>. In <i>Sanatepeque</i> wee met with a Frier
who gave us stately entertainment, and from thence gave us <i>Indians</i> to guide us to <i>Tapanatepeque</i>,
and a letter to the chiefe of the Towne (which also was at his command)
to give us Mules to carry us, and <i>Indians</i> to guide us up the mountaines. Here the rest of
our Horses also failed us, but their wearinesse was no hinderance to us, for the <i>Indians</i>
were willing to give us as much or more then they had cost us, because they were
true <i>Mexican</i> breed, and all the way we went to <i>Chiapa</i> and through that country to
<i>Guatemala</i> the Towns were to provide us of Mules for nothing. We came to <i>Tapanatepeque</i>
(which standeth at the bottome and foot of <i>Quelenes</i>) on Saturday night, and
with the letter we carried were very much welcomed and entertained well by the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>This Towne is one of the sweetest and pleasantest of any we had seen from <i>Guaxaca</i>
thither, and it seems God hath replenished it with all sorts of comforts which Travailers
may need to ascend up those dangerous and steepy rockes. Here is great plenty
of cattel for flesh, and rich <i>Indians</i> which have farmes, called there <i>Estantia's</i>, in some
a thousand, in some three or four thousand head of cattell; fowles here are in abundance,
fish the best store and choisest of any Towne from <i>Mexico</i> thither; for the Sea
is hard by it, and besides there runneth by it a small river which yeelds divers sorts of
fish. From the mountaines there fall so many springs of water, that with them the
<i>Indians</i> water at their pleasure their gardens which are stored with much herbage and
sallets. The shade which defends from the heat (which there is great) is the daughter
of most sweet and goodly fruit trees, and of Orange, Lemmon, Citron and Fig
leaves. The Sabbath morning was so calme that we desired to make use of it, lest by
longer delayes the winds should stay us, or force us to the coast of <i>Soconusco</i>. But
the <i>Indians</i> intreated us to bee their guests at dinner, not doubting but the weather
would hold, and promising us to provide us strong and lusty Mules, and provision of
fruits, and fried fish, or fowles, or what our selves desired. We could not refuse this
their kind offer, and so stayed dinner with them. After dinner our Mules were brought,
and two <i>Indians</i> to guide us and carry our provision, which was some fried fish, and a
cold rosted Capon, with some fruit as much as might suffice us for a day, for the chief
ascent and danger is not above seven leagues, or one and twenty <i>English</i> miles, and
then beyond the top of the mountaines three miles is one of the richest farms for Horses,
Mules, and Cattel, in all the Countrey of <i>Chiapa</i>, where we knew we should be
welcomed by one <i>Don John de Toledo</i>, who then lived there. Though these mountaines
shew themselves with severall sharp pointed heads, and are many joyned together,
yet one of them is only mentioned in that Country by the Travailers, which is called
<i>Maquilapa</i>, over the which lieth the way to <i>Chiapa</i>. To this high, steepy, and craggy
<i>Maquilapa</i> we tooke our journey after dinner, and were by the proud mountaine
that night well entertained, and harboured in a green plot of ground resembling a
meadow, which lay as a rib of the one side of that huge and more then <i>Pyrenian</i> monster.
The <i>Indians</i> comforted us with the shews of faire weather, and told us that they
doubted not but the next day at noone we should be at <i>Don John de Toledo</i> his <i>Estancia</i>,
or farme. With this we spread our supper upon the green table-cloth, and at that first
meale eat up our Capon and most of the provision of our cold fried fish, leaving only
a bit for our mornings breakefast, the springs of water like Conduit-pipes, trickling
downe the rockes, gave us melodious musicke to our supper; the <i>Indians</i> fed merrily,
and our Mules contentedly, and so the fountaine Nymphes sung us asleep till morning,
which seemed to us as calme and quiet as the day before, and encouraged us hastily to
snatch that bit which we had left and so up from breakefast, to say merrily, up to <i>Maquilapa</i>.
We had not winded the mountaine upwards much above a mile, when the
higher we mounted, the more we heard the wind from above whistling unto us, and forbidding
us to goe any further. We were now halfe way up, and doubtfull what wee
should doe, whither go forward, or returne to <i>Tapanatepeque</i> to eat more fish, or to stay
where we were a while untill the weather were more calme, which we thought might
be at noone or towards evening. The <i>Indians</i> told us that about a mile further there
was a fountaine of water, and a lodge made under trees on purpose for Travailers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
were either benighted or hindred by the winds to compasse their journey up the mountaine.
Thither we went with much adoe, hoping the wind would fall; but still the
higher we climbed, the stronger we felt the breath or <i>Æolus</i>, and durst not like the
people called <i>Psilli</i> (of whom <i>Herodotus</i> writeth) march against him, least as they in
stead of a victory found a grave in the sands where they met to oppose him, so we in stead
of ascending should by a furious blast be made to descend into those deep and horrid
precipices, which truely threatned death, and offered themselves to be a grave unto our
torne and mangled bodies. We liked the fountaine very well, and the lodge better for
the harbour of trees which compassed it about. The wind kept on breathing, and we
stood still fearing, till the day was so farre spent that we had no hopes of going back,
or forward. Of any supper we despaired that night, who would have been glad now
to have picked a bone of a Capons leg, or to have sucked a fishes head, and saw there
was nothing for us, but only to feed our hungry stomackes with the remembrance of the
plenty the night before. Thus gazing one upon another, and sometimes looking down to
the fountaine, sometimes looking up to the trees, we perceived amongst them a Lemmon
tree, full of small and very sowre green Lemmons. It was not with us as with
<i>Tantalus</i> who could neither injoy the fruit above him, nor the waters beneath him; we
could and did most greedily catch and snatch the Lemmons, which were sawce for no
meate, but onely to fill an empty stomack; with them wee supped and tooke our rest.
The next morning the wind was rather stronger then calmer, and we as strong the second
day as the first in our purpose of staying there, and not turning our backes like
Cowards. The <i>Indians</i> were also willing to stay yet one day longer; so we fell to our
breakefast of Lemmons which were somewhat coole to a fasting stomack, and relished
nothing the better with a draught from the cleere fountaine. And of what we left on
the tree we made our dinner and supper, adding to our water what we saw the <i>Indians</i>
did drinke, who had their small bags full of powder of their Maiz, of which first making
cakes as dry as bisket they then grind them to powder, and when they travaile,
carry with them that powder to drink with water. This wee thought might bee more
nourishing to us, then Lemmons and water onely, and so for that day we bought of
them halfe a bagfull of powder giving for it in our want and necessity four rials, or two
<i>English</i> shillings, which out of <i>Maquilapa</i> and that our feare of starving might not be
worth above a penny; and yet this was but weake nourishment for our feeble bodies.
Thus we waited all Tuesday for the laying of the wind, resolving the next morning either
to goe up the hill, or downe againe to <i>Tapanatepeque</i>. But on Wednesday morning
the wind seeming to be somewhat laid, we purposed to stay till noon hoping then it
would be sure travailing; but it ceased not but rather increased a little; whereupon one
of our company resolved to goe upwards a mile or two on foot, and trie the passages,
and the danger of the wind and to bring us word againe; for we thought our
feare might be greater then the danger, who had heard much talke, but had not as yet
seen any thing worth our feare. Up therefore went our friend, who staid from us neer
two houres, and then returning backe he told us he thought we might get up leading
our Mules by the bridles. But what with further questions and debates the time passed
away, so that we thought it might be too late; and for that day we put off our journey
untill the next morning, resolutely purposing to goe forwards altogether if the wind
were not much increased. So that day we fell again to our green crabby Lemmons, water
and Maiz powder, all which we found had much weakned our bodies and feared if
we continued there any longer they might hasten our death. Wherefore on Thursday
morning (the wind being as the day before) commending our selves first unto the protection
of that Lord whom the winds and sea obey, we mounted up upon our Mules
(leaving our names written in the barke of a great tree, and the dayes we stayed there
without food) and so went upward. Wee perceived no great danger in the wind a
great while, but some steps and passages upon stony rockes we feared for the narrownesse
of them, and there we lighted, thinking our selves safer upon our own two feet, then
upon the four feet of a beast. But when we came up to the very top of <i>Maquilapa</i> (which
signifies in that tongue, A head without haire) we perceived truly the danger so much
talked of, and wished our selves again with our green Lemmons in the way to <i>Tapanatepeque</i>,
for we found it indeed a head without haire, a top without a tree or branch to
shelter a fearfull Traveller; the passage that lieth open to the sea may be no more than
a quarter of a mile, but the height and narrownesse of it stupefieth, for if we looke on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the one side, there is the wide and spatious South-sea lying so deep and low under it
that it dazleth the eies to behold it; if wee looke on the other side, there are rockes of
at least six or seven miles depth; whose sight doth make the stoutest and hardest heart
(though like themselves) to quake and quiver; so that here the sea expects to swallow,
there the rockes threaten to tear with a downfall, and in the midst of those dangers in
some places the passage is not above an ell broad. We needed better cordialls for that
quarter of a mile then feeding three daies upon green Lemmons and water, and durst not
man our selves so much as to goe through it upon our Mules; we lighted, and gave the
<i>Indians</i> our Mules to lead, and we followed them one by one not daring to walk upright
for fear of head giddinesse with looking on either side, but bowing our bodies we crept
upon our hands and feet as neere unto the trackes which beasts and Travailers had made
as we could without hindering our going. And when we had got to the end of that
passage, and where the mountaine was broader, and the trees promised reliefe, we then
looked back boldly, and accused of folly both our selves and all other Travailers that
sought no other way though ten miles about, to avoid that danger both for man and
beast. From thence joyfully we made haste to <i>Don John de Toledo</i>, who made us welcome
and gave us some warme broath to comfort our stomacks, which were so weake
that no sooner had wee eat any thing, but presently we cast it up againe; till after many
sups of broath and wine we recovered strength towards night, and eat our suppers;
there we stayed two daies; and thus thoroughly refreshed wee went to <i>Acapala</i> a very
great Towne of <i>Indians</i> in the Province of <i>Chiapa</i>, standing by the same river that
passeth by <i>Chiapa</i>, which is called <i>Chiapa de Indios</i>, or <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, to distinguish
it from another <i>Chiapa</i>, called <i>Chiapa Reall</i> the Roial <i>Chiapa</i>, or <i>Chiapa de
Espanoles, Chiapa</i> of the <i>Spaniards</i>. From <i>Acapala</i> we went first to <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>,
which standeth almost as low as <i>Maquilapa</i> is high, seated upon a river as broad
as is the <i>Thames</i> at <i>London</i>, which hath its spring from the mountaines called <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>,
in the rode from <i>Chiapa Real</i> to <i>Guatemala</i>, and runnes towards the Province
of <i>Zoques</i>, where it entreth into the river of <i>Tabasco</i>. But of this <i>Chiapa</i> I will speak
a little more in the next Chapter, and now onely say that here we were joyfully entertained
by those Fryers, who looked upon us as members belonging to the Corporation
of that their Province, and assured us that the Provinciall and chief Superiour would
be very glad of our coming, who wanted <i>Spanish</i> Fryers to oppose the Criolians and
Natives who strived to get a head as they had done in <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Guaxaca</i>. Here we understood
that the Provinciall was not above one daies journey from thence. Here also
we met with our friend <i>Peter Borallo</i>, who had come before us alone, and made his
escape from <i>Mexico</i>: he comforted us much with the good and kind usage which he had
found there; yet he told us how <i>Calvo</i> was gone with the rest of his traine from <i>Mexico</i>
to <i>Acapulco</i>, &amp; from thence was shipped with them to <i>Philippinas</i>; but that at his departure
he had writ a letter of bitter complaints unto the Superiour of <i>Chiapa</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>
against him and us four, desiring the Provinciall not to entertaine us, but to send us
backe to <i>Mexico</i>, to be shipped from thence the next yeer unto <i>Philippinas</i>; which letter
was not regarded; but much slighted by the Provinciall. After we had been a week
feasted in <i>Chiapa</i>, we thought it now fit to present our selves to the Provinciall (whose
name was Fryer <i>Peter Alvarez</i>) that from him we might receive judgement, and know
whether we should stay in that Province, or be forced to return to <i>Spaine</i>, for in no other
part of <i>America</i> we could be entertained. We found the Provinciall in a little Towne
called <i>St. Christopher</i>, between <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i> and the Roiall <i>Chiapa</i>, recreating
himselfe in the shady walkes, which are many sweet and pleasant in that small Towne;
where also there is store of fish, and great abundance of rare, and exquisite fruits.
He entertained us very lovingly with faire and comfortable words, with a stately dinner
and supper, and before we went to bed, to shew his humility hee did unto us what
Christ to his Disciples, hee washed our feet. The first day he said little or nothing
unto us concerning our continuing in that Country; but the next day he discovered
unto us his full resolutions, with many wile and cunning sophismes. For first he read
unto us the letter which <i>Calvo</i> had writ unto him against us, glossing upon it how ill we
had done in forsaking our first love and calling to <i>Philippinas</i>, and the danger many
<i>Indian</i> soules might bee in by reason of our not going thither to convert and instruct
them, whose gifts and abilities he supposed might have been more profitable and comfortable
to those souls, then those who in our stead and absence should be sent amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
them. And secondly hee told us how wee had frustrated the King of <i>Spaines</i> good
hopes of us who had allowed us means and maintenance from <i>Spain</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, hoping
that by us many soules of <i>Indians</i> in <i>Philippinas</i> might bee saved. Thirdly, hee told
us that hee looked upon us as his prisoners, in whose power it was to imprison us, and
to send us Prisoners to <i>Mexico</i> to the Viceroy, to bee shipped from thence to <i>Manila</i>,
according to <i>Calvo</i> his demand. But for the present hee would not let us know what
hee meant to doe with us; Onely hee bad us not to bee discouraged, but to be merry
and recreate our selves, and that after dinner wee should know more from him, when
he had received an answer to a Letter which hee had writ unto the City of <i>Chiapa</i> concerning
the disposall of our persons. These reasonings of the grave and old Provinciall
did not a little sad our hearts; for the losse of soules, and King of <i>Spain</i> his intentions
and charity charged upon us, and imprisonment spoke of by the by, were words
which seemed of a very high straine, and so could hardly bee digested by us; this mornings
breakfast had quite taken away from us our stomack to our dinner. And thus
wee departed from the presence of the venerable Fryer <i>Peter Alvarez</i>, and betooke our
selves to a shady walke under Orange trees belonging to the house where this Superiour
was. In this shade wee conferred with our selves upon the words of <i>Alvarez</i>, and
finding them of so high a nature, as involving soules, a King, and imprisonment, we
thought verily wee should bee sent back to <i>Mexico</i>, and from thence like fugitive slaves
bee forced to <i>Philippinas</i>. Here my hopes of ever more seeing <i>England</i> were lost; <i>Antonio
Melendez</i> his heart panted, wished himself again upon the highest top of <i>Maquilapa</i>;
another wished himselfe with old <i>Calvo</i> at Sea sailing to <i>Manila</i>, though it were but to
help him scrape his rusty Gammons of Bacon.</p>

<p>The motion was made to make an escape from <i>Alvarez</i>, as wee had done from
<i>Calvo</i>; but to this answer was made, that whither so ever wee went, not knowing the
Country, wee should bee discovered; and that put case the worst, wee should bee sent
to <i>Mexico</i>, wee might better escape in the way, then there where wee were. At last I
told the rest, that I could conceive no hard nor harsh usage from that smiling
and loving countenance of the Provinciall, nor after that his low and humble act of washing
our feet the night before; and that I thought verily hee wished us well for having
come so far to offer our selves for fellow-labourers in that harvest of souls belonging to
his charge, and whom wee knew wanted such as we were newly come from <i>Spain</i> to oppose
the Criolians or Natives faction in that Province; alleadging furthermore the
example of our friend and companion <i>Peter Borallo</i>, whom hee had already incorporated
into that province, and could doe no lesse with us without partiality and acceptation
of persons. And lastly, my opinion was, that in case wee ought not to be entertained
there, yet the Provinciall would not send us back to <i>Mexico</i>, there to be disgraced
and affronted, but would give way unto us to returne to <i>Spain</i>, or whither else wee
would, with some relief and mony in our purses. Whilst wee were thus troubled, and
in this sad and serious discourse, old <i>Alvarez</i> it seemes had been eying of us from his
window, and as <i>Joseph</i> could not long suppresse and keep in the expressions of a loving
and tender heart unto his brethren; so this good Superior perceiving that we were troubled
with what he had said unto us, sent his companion unto us to comfort us; which
wee easily perceived by his discourse when hee came unto us. For as soone as hee came
hee asked us why wee were so sad and melancholy? hee told us, the Provinciall also
had observed that wee were troubled. But, said hee, bee of good cheare; bee confident
that the Provinciall wisheth you very well, and needeth such as you are, and having
come into his Dominion to thrust your selves upon his mercy, by harsh and unkind
usage hee will not doe what Martiall Law forbids a hard hearted Souldier to doe unto
his enemy upon such termes. Many such comfortable words did he speak unto us; and
told us further that the Provinciall had been much censured by the Criolian party for
entertaining of <i>Peter Borallo</i>; and that now they would stir worse seeing four more
come to weaken their faction; and therefore hee desired to bee well advised concerning
us, and to carry our businesse with such discretion, as might give little offence to those
who were apt to judge and censure the best of all his actions. And finally hee did assure
us, that wee should never bee sent back as prisoners to <i>Mexico</i> by the Provinciall,
who in case hee could not entertaine us in <i>Chiapa</i>, or <i>Guatemala</i>, would further us
with all his favour, and friends, and money in our purses to return againe to <i>Spain</i>.
These reasons were heart fainting Cordials unto us, and stomack preparatives to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
good dinner, to which by the sound of a bell wee were invited. When wee came in,
the loving, smiling, and fatherly countenance of the good Provinciall did chear us more
then all the cheare that waited for us upon the table in severall dishes, all which were
seasoned to our palates with the sauce of the comfort, which the Provincials messenger
had brought unto us in the shady Orange walke in the garden. The great provision
of fish and flesh, with fruits and sweet meats were yet to us a strong argument that wee
were very welcome; for what wee fed on that day, might well become a Noble mans
Table; besides in many passages of our discourse wee perceived that good old <i>Alvarez</i>
his heart was overjoyed with our comming to him. Dinner being ended the Provinciall
desired to play a game at Tables with us round about, saying hee would not win
our money, because hee judged us poore after so long a journey. But thus hee setled
the game and sport; that if he did win, we should say for him five <i>Pater Nosters</i>, and five
<i>Ave Maries</i>; but if wee wun, wee should win our admittance, and Incorporation into
that Province. This sport pleased us well, for our winnings wee judged would be
to us more profitable at that time, then to winne pounds, and our loosings we valued
not; besides wee were confident all went well with us, when from the favour of the
Dice, wee might challenge that favour which with many weary journeys wee had
come to seek above foure hundred miles. The sport began, and wee young blades
taking one by one our turnes were too hard for the old man, who (as wee perceived)
would willingly bee the loser, that his very losses might speak unto us what through
policy and discretion hee would not utter with words. Yet wee boldly challenged
our winnings, which as soone as wee had ended our game were now surely confirmed
unto us by the returne of an <i>Indian</i> messenger, who that morning had
been sent to the City of <i>Chiapa</i> for advice and counsell from the Prior and the chiefe
of the Cloister concerning our disposal, and now was returned with an answer from the
Prior, who in his letter expressed great joy unto the Provinciall for our comming,
and so from the rest of the Seniors of the Cloister, and did earnestly begge of the Superiour,
that hee would send us to him to bee his guests, for that our case had beene
his owne some ten yeers before, for hee had also at <i>Mexico</i> forsaken his company to
<i>Philippinas</i>, and fled to <i>Guatemala</i>, where for his learning and good parts hee had
been as a stranger much envied by the Criolian faction; but now hee hoped hee
should have some to side with him against such as spighted and maligned him. Old <i>Alvarez</i>
was much taken with his letter, and told us hee must pay what hee had lost, and
that the next day he would send us to <i>Chiapa</i>, there to abide untill hee tooke further
care of us, to send us to other parts of the Country, to learne the <i>Indian</i> languages, that
wee might preach unto them. This discourse being ended wee betooke our selves again
to the Garden which smelled more of comfort then before dinner, and to our shady
walks which now offered us a safer protection then they had done in the forenoone,
countenancing that protection which we had gained from the Provinciall.</p>

<p>Here we began to praise God, who had looked upon us in our low estate, not forgetting
the wise and politick Provinciall, who though hee had lost his games for our
comfort, wee would not hee should lose our prayers, which there wee offered up to
God for his health and safety. And so till supper time wee continued our discourse in
the Garden fuller of mirth and pleasant jests, then wee had done before dinner, snatching
now and then at the Oranges and Lemmons, which were there both sowre and
sweet, eating of some, and casting some one at another, but especially at him who had
wished himselfe with <i>Calvo</i> dressing his rusty Bacon, whom we strived to beat out of the
garden by force of Orange and Lemmon bullets; which sport we continued the more
willingly, because wee perceived the good Provinciall stood behind a Lattice in a Balcony
beholding us, and rejoycing to see our hearts so light and merry. Wee had
no sooner beat <i>Calvo</i> his friend out of the garden, when the bell to supper sounded a
retreat to us all, and called us again to meet our best friend <i>Alvarez</i>, who had furnished
us a Table againe like that at noone. After supper hee told us that the next morning
hee would send us to <i>Chiapa</i>, for that the Prior had writ unto him he would meet
us in the way with a Breakfast at a Towne called St. <i>Philip</i>; wherewith wee conceited
very highly of our selves to see that Provincialls and Priors were so forward to feast
us. Yet before we went to bed, the Provinciall would try again a game at Tables with
every one of us, to see if now hee could beat us that had been too hard for him at noon.
The matter of our game was now altered, and what we played for was this; if the Provinciall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
wun, wee were to bee his Prisoners, (which mystery wee understood not till the
next day, for the old man was crafty and Politick, and knew hee could winne of us
when he listed, for hee was an excellent gamester at Tables) but if wee wun of him,
hee was to give us a box of <i>Chocolatte</i>, which was a drinke wee liked very well. The
Game went on, and wee every one of us one by one were losers, yet understood not
how wee should bee his Prisoners, but slighted our losses. Yet for all this the merry
Provinciall told us, hee was sory wee had lost, and wished wee might never bee prisoners
to a worse enemie then hee; and that wee should perceive it, hee would comfort
us each one as a Prisoner with a box of <i>Chocolatte</i>, to drinke for his sake, and to comfort
our hearts, when most wee should find them discomforted for our losses. Wee understood
not his meaning till the next day at noone, but thought it was a jest and a
word of sport and mirth, like many such like which in his discourse had come from
him.</p>

<p>With this wee tooke our leaves, and went to bed with light and merry hearts. In
the morning two Mules of the Provinciall and two of his Companion were sadled for
us, and at least a dozen <i>Indians</i> on horse back waited for us to conduct us up a steepy
hill and through woods to the Towne of St. <i>Philip</i>. After our breakfast the good Provinciall
imbraced us, and bad us farewell, desiring us to pray for him; and not to bee
discouraged by any thing that might befall us, assuring us hee wished us very well, and
would doe what lay in his power for our good; yet so, that hee must use policy and
discretion to stop the mouths of the Criolians, whom hee knew hated both him and us.
Thus we departed with Waits and Trumpets sounding before us, which rebounded an
Echo all the way up the hill from us to old <i>Alvarez</i> whom we had left in a low bottome
compassed about with hils on every side. Wee had no sooner ascended up to the top of
the Mountaine, when we discovered a little Valley, and in it the City of <i>Chiapa</i> of the
<i>Spaniards</i>; with two or three small Villages, of which one was St. <i>Philip</i> at the bottom
of the Mountaine, which we were to descend. The Trumpets which still went sounding
before us were a sufficient and loud Alarme to St. <i>Philips</i> Inhabitants of our coming,
and a warning for the speedier hastening of our second breakfast, for the which
the cold morning aire (which wee found somewhat piercing upon the Mountaine)
had whetted and through prepared our stomacks. We had not got down the Mountaine
halfe a mile, when wee met with a matter of twenty gallant <i>Indians</i> on horse-back
with their trumpeters sounding before them, and behind them came upon a stately
Mule the Prior of <i>Chiapa</i>, (whose name was Father <i>John Baptist</i>) a merry fat Fryer,
who calling us his brethren fugitives from <i>Philippinas</i>, told us wee were welcome to
that country, and to him especially, and that in the next St. <i>Philip</i> he would shew us better
sport, then any <i>St. Philip</i> in all the <i>Philippinas</i> Islands could have shewed us, if wee
had gone thither. Thus with a pleasant discourse, and many merry conceits from
the good Prior wee soone came downe the hill, where the whole Village of St. <i>Philip</i>
waited for us both men and women, some presenting unto us nosegaies, others hurling
Roses and other flowers in our faces, others dancing before us all along the street,
which was strowed with herbes and Orange leaves, and adorned with many Arches
made with flowers and hung with garlands for us to ride under untill wee came to the
Church, where for halfe an houre wee were welcomed with the best musick from the
City of <i>Chiapa</i>, which the Prior had hired to come with him to entertaine us. Our
Musick being ended, fat Father <i>John Baptist</i> stood up and made a short speech unto
the <i>Indians</i>, giving them thankes for their kind and pompous entertainment of us
his speciall friends, and that their soules might gaine by it, hee granted unto them
a plenary indulgence of all their sinnes past to bee gained by as many of them as should
visit that Church the next Lords Day either before or afternoon. And thus from the
Altar wee went unto our breakfasting Table, which was furnished with many well seasoned
dishes of salt and well peppered and spiced meats, all fit to make us relish better
a cup of <i>Spanish Pier Ximeny</i> which the Prior had provided for us. After our salt meats,
came such rare and exquisite sorts of sweet meats made by <i>John Baptist</i> his best devoted
Nuns of <i>Chiapa</i>, that the like wee had not seen from St. <i>John de Ulhua</i> to that place.
These were to prepare our stomacks for a Cup of <i>Chocolatte</i>, with the which we ended
our breakfast. But whilst all this was gallantly performed by the Prior, it was a hard
Riddle unto us, what hee often repeated unto us saying, Brethren break your fast well,
for your dinner will be the meanest as ever yee did eate in your lives, and now enjoy
this sweet liberty which will not last long unto you. Wee observed the words, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
knew not what to make of them, till wee came unto the Cloister. After our breakfast
the <i>Indians</i> shewed us a little sport in the Market place, running races on horse-back,
and playing at <i>Juego de Canna's</i>; which is to meet on horseback, with broad Targets
to defend their heads and shoulders while passing by they hurle Canes, or darts one at another,
which those <i>Indians</i> acted with great dexterity.</p>

<p>Thus the good Prior of <i>Chiapa</i> feasted us, and permitted us to injoy our liberty as
long as it seemes it had beene agreed upon by letters between him and the Provinciall,
which was till it might be dinner time in the Cloister of <i>Chiapa</i>, where wee were to bee
before noone. The time drew neere, and we had from St. <i>Philip</i> to the City of <i>Chiapa</i>
some two <i>English</i> miles to ride; Wherefore the Prior commanded our Mules to bee
brought; the waits and trumpets gave warning to the Town of our departure; and so
with many horsemen, with dances, Musick and ringing of Bells wee were as
stately and joyfully conducted out of the Town, as wee had been inducted into it.
At the first halfe miles end the Prior gave thankes unto the <i>Indians</i>, and desired
them to return, the Cloister being neer where wee expected another kinde of
entertainment, not using in the City and Cloister that pompe and state, which
in the Country might bee allowed. The <i>Indians</i> tooke their leaves of us; and on we
went with onely two as guides before us. Within halfe a mile of the City, the Prior
and a companion of his stopped, and tooke out of his pocket an order from the Provinciall,
which he read unto us, to this effect, That whereas we had forsaken our lawfull
Superior <i>Calvo</i> in the way to <i>Philippinas</i>, and without his licence had come unto
the Province of <i>Chiapa</i>, hee could not in conscience but inflict some punishment upon
us before he did enable us to abide there as members under him; therefore hee did strictly
command the Prior of <i>Chiapa</i>, that as soone as wee should enter into his Cloister,
hee should shut us up two by two in our chambers, as in prisons, for three daies, not
suffering us to goe out to any place, save onely to the publick place of refection (called
Refectory) where all the Fryers met together to dine and sup, where at noon time we
were to present our selves before all the Cloister sitting upon the bare ground, and there
to receive no other dinner, but only bread and water; but at supper we might have in our
chambers, or Prisons, what the Prior would be pleased to allow us. This was the Penance
enjoined upon us by the wise and cunning Provinciall. This newes at the first
was but sowre sawce, or a dry Postpast after a double sumptuous breakfast; it was a
dolefull ditty to us after our Musick, and dances, to heare of a treble fast after our feast;
to heare of imprisonment after so great liberty. We now began to remember the Provincialls
winnings at Tables the night before, and the mystery thereof, and began
to thinke how comfortable his boxes of <i>Chocolatte</i> would be unto us after a meale
of bread and water. Now wee called to minde the short dinner the Prior had told us
at St. <i>Philips</i> wee were like to have that day, and of the liberty hee bad us then make
much of. But the good Prior seeing us sad upon a suddaine, and our countenances
changed, smiled upon us, wishing us not to thinke the worse of him, nor of the Provinciall,
who did that out of Policy, and to stop the Criolians mouths, whom he knew
would murmur, if no punishment were inflicted upon us. Hee assured us, after our imprisonment,
of honours and preferments, and that as long as wee were with him, wee
should want no incouragement; and that after a bread and water dinner hee could send
us to our chambers a Supper, that should strongly support our empty stomacks, and furre
and line them well for the next foure and twenty houres. With these incouragements
on wee went to the Cloister of <i>Chiapa</i>, where wee were welcomed by most of the Fryers,
but in some few wee noted a frowning and disaffected countenance. We were no
sooner conducted to our chambers, when the bell sounded to dinner for the rest, and
cryed aloud to us Penance with bread and water. Downe wee went to the common
dining place, and thanks being given, the Fryers sitting round the tables, wee foure
<i>Philippinian Jonahs</i> (so some Criolians were pleased to term us) betook our selves to
the middle of the Refectory, where without cushions, stooles, seats or forms, wee sate
upon the bare ground crosse legged like Tailors, acting humility now for our disobedience
unto slovenly <i>Calvo</i>. While the first dish was presented round the tables, to each of us
was presented a loafe of reasonable bignesse, and a pot of pure Crystall water, whereof
wee fed and dranke most heartily though with full stomacks from a double breakfast
before. Yet even here in this publick Act of shame and disgrace (which wee knew
was usuall among Fryers for lesse faults then ours) we had this comfort, that we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a Prior and Provinciall for friends, and that that punishment came from a friendly
hand, whose Chocolatte wee had to comfort our fasting bodies; and secondly,
wee knew that wee should have that night in our prison chambers a better
supper than any of those before us, who fed upon their three or foure dishes.
But thirdly, it was our comfort that at that very time a Criolian Frier also sate upon
the ground with us (of whose company we had been informed by some friends before
wee went into the refectory) for some love letters which had been intercepted between
him and a Nun of that City, tending to much uncivility, and breaking their
oath of professed chastity. But when I perceived this Frier to looke discontentedly
upon us, I chose my place as neer unto him as I could, and hearing him mutter within
himselfe against us, calling us disobedient <i>Philippinian Jonahs</i>, I softly and friendly
spoke unto him with these two following Hexameters, which suddenly came unto my
mind about his misdemeanor.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Si Monialis Amor te turpia scribere fecit,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ecce tibi frigidæ præhent medicamina lymphæ.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>But my good neighbour snuffing and puffing at my suddain muse, seemed to be more
discontented then before, and would faine withdraw himselfe by degrees from mee,
not rising up (for that was not lawfull to doe till dinner had been ended) but wrigling
his elbowes and shoulders scornefully from me, whom in like manner I followed, cleaving
friendly to him with this verse,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Solamen misera est socios retinere Panettes,</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Hee thought I followed him to steale away his loafe from him. This new
found word, <i>Panettes</i>, had almost choaked him, had not hee made use of
the medicinall water which stood before him; of the which he dranke a good draught,
whereby I perceived his courage against me and my friends was tamed, and I told him,
I hoped his burning wanton love was cooled.</p>

<p>Thus with my Criolian neighbours company my bread and water went down cheerfully;
and dinner being ended, we were again conducted to our chambers, where
we dranke a cup of old <i>Alvarez</i> his <i>Chocolatte</i>. The <i>Castilian</i> Friers flocked unto our
prisons, some to talke with us, some bringing us conserves and sweet-meats, others
other dainties, which they had prepared to helpe our digestion of bread and cold water.
My suddain verses to my Criolian neighbour were presently noysed about the
Cloister, and were the chiefe subject of our talke that afternoone. Our supper was provided
for us according to the promise and generous spirit of the Prior, who also honoured
our prison that night with his owne and two other Friers company supping
with us all in one chamber together. And thus we passed our three daies of imprisonment
merrily and contentedly, wishing we might never suffer harder usage in any prison
then we had done in this, which was not to us such a punishment as did bring with it
the privation of any liberty of enjoying the company of friends, of feasting with
them, but onely the privation of the liberty of our legs to walke about those three
daies; and this rather an ease then a punishment, for that we wanted rather rest, then
much stirring after so long and tedious a journey as we had compassed from <i>Mexico</i> thither.
We were no sooner set at liberty, but we presently found the Provinciall and
Prior ready to dispose of us so, that in lieu of our imprisonment we might receive
honor and credit. Two were sent into the Country to learne some <i>Indian</i> language,
that so they might be beneficed and preach unto the <i>Indians</i>. My selfe and another desired
to goe farther to <i>Guatemala</i>, that there we might practise Philosophy and Divinity
in the famous Universitie of that City. Nothing that we desired was denied unto
us, onely the time was thought not fit untill <i>Michaelmas</i>, because then the schooles
were renewed, and new Orders setled. In the meane time the Provinciall having also
heard of my verses <i>ex tempore</i> to the Criolian Frier, and knowing that the <i>Latin</i> tongue
is better grounded in <i>England</i> then among the <i>Spaniards</i> (who abuse poore <i>Priscian</i> and
daily breake his pate with foolish soloecismes) and considering the want hee had of a
Master of the <i>Latine</i> tongue to supply a Lecture of Grammar and Syntax to the
youthes of <i>Chiapa</i> in a schoole in that Cloister, which brought a sufficient yeerly stipend
unto the Covent, desired me to accept of that place untill such time as he should take
care to send me to <i>Guatemala</i>, promising me all incouragements in the meane time fitting,
and that I should when I would go about to see the Country (which I much desired)
and also that out of the schoole annuity I should have my allowance for bookes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and other necessaries. I could not but accept of this good offer; and so with this imployment
I remained in that City from <i>Aprill</i> to the end of <i>September</i>, where I was
much esteemed of by the Bishop and Governour, but especially by the Prior, who
would never ride about the Country for his recreation, but he would take me with him,
whereby I had occasion to note concerning the Province, riches, commodities, and
government of <i>Chiapa</i>, what in the ensuing Chapter I shall faithfully commend unto
the Presse.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XV" id="CHAP_XV">CHAP. XV.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Describing the Countrey of</i> Chiapa, <i>with the chiefest Townes and Commodities
belonging unto it.</i></h4>


<p>Though <i>Chiapa</i> in the opinion of the <i>Spaniards</i> be held to be one of the poorest
Countries of <i>America</i>; because in it as yet there have been no mines discovered,
nor golden sands found in the rivers, nor any haven upon the South-sea,
whereby commodities are brought in and carried out, as to <i>Mexico, Guaxaca</i>
and <i>Guatemala</i>; yet I may say it exceedeth most Provinces in the greatness and beauty of
fair Towns, and yeeldeth to none except it be to <i>Guatemala</i>; nay it surpasseth
all the rest of <i>America</i> in that one, and famous and most populous Towne of <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>.
And it ought not to be so much slighted by the <i>Spaniards</i> as it is, if they would
looke upon it as standing between <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>, whose strength might be all
<i>Americaes</i> strength, and whose weakenesse may prove dangerous to all that flourishing
Empire, for the easy entrance into it by the river of <i>Tabasco</i>, or for its neer joyning
and bordering unto <i>Jucatan</i>. Besides, the commodities in it are such as doe uphold
a constant trading and commerce amongst the inhabitants themselves, and with other
neighbouring Countries, and from no one part of <i>America</i> doth <i>Spaine</i> get more
<i>Cochinil</i> then from one of the Provinces of <i>Chiapa</i>; the Townes also being great and
populous, by their yeerly pole tribute do adde much to the King of <i>Spaines</i> revenues.</p>

<p>This Country is divided into three Provinces, to wit, <i>Chiapa, Zeldales</i>, and <i>Zoques</i>;
whereof <i>Chiapa</i> it selfe is the poorest. This containes the great Towne of <i>Chiapa</i> of
the <i>Indians</i>, and all the Townes and farmes North-ward towards <i>Maquilapa</i>, and
West-ward the Priory of <i>Comitlan</i>, which hath some ten Townes, and many farmes
of Cattle, Horses, and Mules subject unto it; and neighbouring unto it lieth the great
valley of <i>Capanabastla</i>, which is another Priory reaching towards <i>Soconuzco</i>. This valley
glorieth in the great river, which hath its spring from the mountaines called <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>,
and runneth to <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, and from thence to <i>Tabasco</i>. It is also
famous for the abundance of fish, which the river yeeldeth, and the great store of Cattell
which from thence minister food and provision both to the City of <i>Chiapa</i>, and to
all the adjacent Townes. Though <i>Chiapa</i> the City, and <i>Comitlan</i> as standing upon the
hils, bee exceeding cold, yet this valley lying low is extraordinary hot, and from <i>May</i>
to <i>Michaelmas</i> is subject to great stormes and tempests of thunder and lightning. The
head Towne where the Priory stands, is called <i>Capanabastla</i>, consisting of above eight
hundred <i>Indian</i> inhabitants. But greater than this is <i>Izquintenango</i> at the end of the
valley and at the foot of the mountaines of <i>Cuchumatlanes</i> Southward. And yet bigger
then this is the Towne of <i>St. Bartholomew</i> Northward at the other end of the valley,
which in length is about fourty miles, and ten or twelve onely in breadth. All the rest
of the Townes lie towards <i>Soconuzco</i>, and are yet hotter and more subject to thunder
and lightning, as drawing neerer unto the South-sea coast. Besides the abundance of cattell,
the chiefe commoditie of this valley consisteth in Cotton-wooll, whereof are
made such store of mantles for the <i>Indians</i> wearing, that the Merchants far and neer come
for them. They exchange them to <i>Soconuzco</i> and <i>Suchutepeques</i> for <i>Cacao</i>, whereby
they are well stored of that drinke. So that the inhabitants want neither fish
(which they have from the river) nor flesh (for that the valley abounds with
Cattell) nor clothing (for of that they spare to others) nor bread, though not of
wheat, for there growes none; but <i>Indian</i> Maiz they have plenty of; and besides they
are exceedingly stored with fowles and Turkeys, fruits, Hony, Tobacco and Sugar-canes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Neither is mony here nor in <i>Chiapa</i> so plentifull as in <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Guaxaca</i>; and
whereas there they reckon by Patacones, or pieces of Eight; here they reckon by
Tostones which are but halfe Patacones. Though the river be many waies profitable
to that valley, yet it is cause of many disasters to the inhabitants, who lose many
times their children, and their Calves and Colts drawing neere to the water-side, where
they are devoured by Caymanes, which are many and greedy of flesh, by reason of the
many prizes they have got. The City of <i>Chiapa Real</i>, is one of the meanest Cities in
all <i>America</i>, consisting of not above four hundred housholders <i>Spaniards</i>, and about an
hundred houses of <i>Indians</i> joyning to the City, and called <i>el barrio de los Indios</i>, who
have a Chappell by themselves. In this City there is no Parish Church, but onely the
Cathedrall, which is mother to all the inhabitants. Besides, there are two Cloisters, one
of Dominicans, and the other of Franciscans, and a poore Cloister of Nuns, which
are burdensome enough to that City. But the Jesuites having got no footing there
(who commonly live in the richest and wealthiest places and Cities) is a sufficient argument
of either the poverty of that City, or of want of gallant parts, and prodigality
in the gentry, from whose free and generous spirits they like Horse-leeches are
still sucking extraordinary and great almes for the Colledges where they live; but here
the Merchants are close handed, and the Gentlemen hard, and sparing, wanting of wit
and Courtiers parts and bravery, and so poore <i>Chiapa</i> is held no fit place for Jesuites.
The Merchants chiefe trading there is in <i>Cacao</i>, Cotton-wool from the adjacent parts
of the Country, in Pedlers small wares, and in some Sugar from about <i>Chiapa</i> of the
<i>Indians</i>, in a little <i>Cochinil</i>; for commonly the Governour (whose chiefe gaine consisteth
in this) will not suffer them to be too free in this commoditie, lest they hinder
his greedy traffique. These have their shops all together in a little Market-place before
the Cathedrall Church, built with walkes and Porches, under which the poore <i>Indian</i>
wives meet at five a clock at evening to sell what slap and drugges they can prepare most
cheape for the empty Criolian stomackes. The richer sort of these Merchants go and
send yet further to <i>Tabasco</i> for wares from <i>Spaine</i>, such as wines, Linnen cloth, Figs,
Raisins, Olives, and Iron, though in these commodities they dare not venture too
much, by reason the <i>Spaniards</i> in that Country are not very many, and those that are
there, are such as are loath to open their purses to more then what may suffice nature. So
that what are <i>Spanish</i> commodities are chiefly brought for the Friers who are the best
and joviallest blades of that Countrey. The Gentlemen of <i>Chiapa</i> are a by-word
all about that Country, signifying great Dons (<i>dones</i>, gifts or abilities I should say)
great birth, phantasticke pride, joyned with simplicity, ignorance, misery and penury.
These Gentlemen will say they descend from some Dukes house in <i>Spain</i>, and immediately
from the first Conquerors; yet in carriage they are but clownes, in wit, abilities,
parts and discourse as shallow brained, as a low brooke, whose waters are
scarce able to leap over a pibble stone; any small reason soone tries and tires their weak
braine, which is easily at a stand when sense is propounded, and slides on speedily when
non-sense carrieth the streame. The chiefe families in this City, are named, <i>Cortez,
Solis, Velasco, Toledo, Zerna</i>, and <i>Mendoza</i>. One of these, who was thought the
chiefe in my time, called <i>Don Melchor de Velasco</i>, one day fell into discourse with mee
concerning <i>England</i>, and our <i>English</i> nation, and in the best, most serious and judicious
part of his Don-like conference, asked me whether the sun and moone in <i>England</i>
were of the same colour as in <i>Chiapa</i>, and whether <i>English</i> men went barefoot like
the <i>Indians</i>, and sacrificed one another as formerly did the Heathens of this Countrey?
and whether all <i>England</i> could afford such a dainty as a dish of Frixoles (which
is the poorest <i>Indians</i> daily food there, being black and dry Turkey or French beanes
boyled with a little biting Chille or <i>Indian</i> pepper with garlicke, till the broath become
as black as any Inke)? And whether the women in <i>England</i> went as long with
child, as did the <i>Spanish</i> women? And lastly, whether the <i>Spanish</i> nation were not a
farre gallanter nation then the <i>English</i>? When I perceived my Don ran farther and
farther into his simple and foolish questions, I cut him off suddenly, telling him, Sir, It
is long since I came out of <i>England</i>, if you give me leave to recollect my memory, I will
answer some of these your hard questions the next time we meet (thinking hereby to
try my Dons wit further, whether he could perceive I jeared him.) To which my simple
Don replyed, I pray Sir doe, and whensoever you come, you shall be welcome to a dish
of Frixoles. With this I tooke my leave of him, and at our farewell, he againe desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
mee to study well his questions, and to return him a speedy answer, whereby I was more
confirmed in my conceit of my <i>Don</i>, that he was either <i>tonto</i> or <i>bobo</i>, foole or simple. Yet
thought I my best way to answer is to answer a fool according to his folly, and so resolved
within two or three daies to return unto him some simple answer according to his simple
and foolish questions. Therefore speedily I singled out a good occasion of meeting with
him at his own house, who welcomed me with much <i>Spanish</i> gravity, and sitting down
before <i>Donna Angela</i>, his painted wife and Angel; began to answer, or more to jeer his
<i>Donship</i>. I began with the Sun and Moon, telling him that they were planets, &amp; had their
speciall influences upon severall nations, as all planets have upon mans body. And so
they did shew themselves according to the inclination of the people of severall Kingdomes.
And therefore as the <i>Spaniards</i> were much inclined to <i>Venus</i> and to beauty, and
not contenting themselves with the naturall beauty of their faire Ladies, would yet
have Art add to nature by the skill and use of the best painting colours; so these glorious
planets of the Sun and Moon among the <i>Spaniards</i>, and especially in <i>Chiapa</i>,
shewed themselves most comely, bright, glorious and beautifull, working the like inclination
to beauty upon, and in all <i>Spaniards</i>. My instance was in the land of the
Blackmores, where I told them that their bodies were black, and that among them
the Sun appeared with a dark and sad visage. Here my <i>Don</i> cried out; An excellent
example. I gave him yet a second instance from the Eclipse of the Sun; which being
eclipsed, made all the Earth, mens faces and bodies seeme of a darke, or yellow colour,
to shew the proportion or sympathy of sublunary bodies to that high and overmastering
planet. To this that good <i>Don</i> replyed; <i>sennor no se puede decir mas</i>, sir, nothing can be answered
or said more or better. <i>Vengamos agora a Ingalatierra</i>, Let us draw now to <i>England</i>.
To which I answered him, that in <i>England</i> the Sun and Moon appeared halfe yeer
of one colour, and half of another; for the women one half yeer it appeared as in
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Chiapa</i>, beautifull and glorious, for that naturally without painting they
yeelded to none in beauty. But the other half yeer it appeared as red as blood, or scarlet;
and the reason might easily bee guessed at, for that no Nation is more warlik and
high spirited then the <i>English</i>, whose very clothes were fiery, wearing more scarlet then
any nation in the World; as hee might perceive by their coming so much with their
ships to the <i>Indian</i> Coasts to fight with the <i>Spaniards</i>; and that as they delighted to
goe in red, and to bee like the Sun, so naturally they were brought to those Seas
to single out such ships as from <i>America</i> carried the rich Commodity of <i>Cochinill</i>, whereof
they make more use then <i>Spain</i> it selfe to die their cloaths and Coats withall. Here
my <i>Don</i> jogged his head, and replyed; Sir, I thought no nation had been so like the
Sun as the <i>Spaniards</i>; for I have read that when our Ancestors came to conquer these
parts, the <i>Indians</i> called them, <i>hijos del Sol</i>, that is, sons of the Sun, being comely and
gallant, and more like the Sun then any other people. To this I answered him. Sir, no
doubt but you are like the Sun here, and none more glittering and bright, your very
hatbands shining with Pearls and Diamonds like the brightnesse of the Sun; But as I
said before the Blackmores are like their Sun, so I say, the <i>English</i> is like their Sun, which
is red, and so doe and will affect to wear Scarlet, as long as any <i>Cochinill</i> is to be found
in the <i>India's</i>.</p>

<p>Now <i>Don Melchor</i> began to understand mee, and told mee, never man had
satisfied him with better reasons then my self. Hee thanked mee heartily, and
told mee, hee thought no Gentleman in <i>Chiapa</i> could tell so well as himself now why
the <i>English</i> ships came so much upon their Coasts; and that my discourse had satisfied
him to the full. Hee desired mee to goe on to his other questions. To his second demanding
whether the <i>English</i> went barefoot like the <i>Indians</i>, I told him I thought
that the Count of <i>Gondomar</i>, (who had been many yeers Ambassadour from <i>Spain</i> in
<i>England</i>) had satisfied all the <i>Spaniards</i> that doubt, who coming from <i>England</i> to <i>Madrid</i>,
and being there asked by some Courtiers, whether <i>London</i> was as big as <i>Madrid</i>,
and as well peopled; he made answer, that hee thought there was scarce a hundred left
in <i>London</i>. Hee proved it from the use and custome of his own Countrymen of <i>Spain</i>;
who when they are to make a journey, shew themselves two or three daies before in
colours, walking with boots and spurs, that their friends may take notice that they are
departing out of the Towne or City. So said the Count of <i>Gondomar</i>, I think by this
there are very few People in <i>London</i>; for when I came from thence I left them all
almost in cloaths of colours, booted and spurred as ready to depart and take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
journey. And truely my <i>Don</i> (quoth I) your owne Count hath answered for mee;
yet I say, the <i>English</i> are so farre from going barefoot, that they goe booted, and
are all in a readinesse to move out of <i>England</i> for any noble and generous designe; but above
all they are still ready for <i>America</i>, where they know is store and abundance
of Hydes to make them Bootes to cover the barenesse of their legges, that they may
not be suspected to be like bare-footed <i>Indians</i>. Here <i>Don Melchor</i> replyed, I pray
sir, when they come by Sea to these parts doe they come also booted and
spurred? For I should thinke, when they fight, their Spurs should hinder them.
To this his doubt I answered first, as concerning spurres in the ships, with the example
of one of his own Nation, and of the best Divines in <i>Spain</i>, living in my time in
<i>Valladolid</i>, called <i>Maestro Nunno</i>, (Reader of Divinity in the Colledge of St. <i>Gregorie</i>,
but in his carriage and experience in the World a simple noddy) who being
invited by a Noble man to goe with him in his Coach out of the City a mile
or two to a garden of recreation, went hastily about the Colledge to borrow boots and
spurs; and when he had put them on, being asked whither he went, and why he put on
boots and spurs, answered that he was to goe in a Coach out of the City, and that hee
thought the Coach and Mules would want spurs to goe and come the sooner. Even so my
<i>Don</i> (quoth I) the <i>English</i> men come booted and spurred in their ships, to make their ships
sail on the swifter. And this is the reason why the <i>English</i> ships saile faster, and when they
are in fight turn about quicker then a <i>Spanish</i> Galeon, because they are spurred &amp; kicked
within. O Sir, I humbly thank you (said <i>Don Melchor</i>) for that by your discourse now I
know the truth of what indeed I have often heard say, that the <i>English</i> ships are
nimbler, and quicker at Sea then our heavy Galeons. Now as for fighting the <i>English</i>
mens spurs (said I) are no hinderance to them, but rather a great advantage. For they
fight with weapons, with their hands and with their feet, wherein they exceed the
<i>Spaniards</i>; for when they have shot with their peeces, or cut down with their swords
any enemy, or knocked him with their holbards, then with their feet and spurres, they
fall upon him, and so soone rid him out of the way, that hee may no more rise up
against them. All you have told mee (said the wise <i>Velazco</i>) stands with so much
reason, that my judgment is convinced by you. As for eating and sacrificing one
another like the <i>Indians</i> (I told him) that the <i>English</i> filled their bellies so well with
fat Beef and Mutton, fowles, Rabbits, Partridges and Pheasants, that they had no
stomacke at all to mans flesh. And that truly for frixoles dressed with garlick, that
onely daintie dish was wanting in <i>England</i>; and that for Garlick, three reasons
moved the <i>English</i> not to bee lavishing of that little they had; first, for feare they
should want it for their horses drenches; secondly, for that they felt not themselves
so much troubled with the wind, nor puffed up with windy and vaine conceits as
other nations did; but thirdly and chiefly they refrained from it among themselves,
that they might not smell of it, and that by the sent and smell of it a farre
off at Sea they might when they came to the Coast of <i>America</i>, smell out a <i>Spanish</i>
ship, and know it from a <i>Hollander</i>. Here my <i>Don Melchor</i> fell into admiration, assuring
mee, hee had never heard more solid reasons from any man. Alas poore
Criolian of <i>Chiapa</i> (thought I) if I had spoken sense, thy shallow braine had not
beene able to have leaped over it, but after non-sense thou art easily carried away.
As for his last question, I told him that was above my reach, for that poore Fryers
ought not to meddle with women, neither had my mother ever told mee how long
shee went with mee. But how ever if <i>Donna Angela</i> would tell mee how long shee
went with her children, I would by the constellations of the Heavens search out against
our next meeting, how long the <i>English</i> women went with their children. To this my
<i>Don Melchor</i> answered that he would not trouble me to study what he thought was not
belonging to my profession; but he knew that if I would study that or any other hard &amp;
difficult point, I could give him more &amp; better satisfaction then any scholar in that City.</p>

<p>And thus (Reader) by this Don <i>Melchors</i> wit and ability would I have thee judge of
the Gentlemen Criolians or natives of <i>Chiapa</i>; and yet as presumptuous they are and
arrogant, as if the noblest bloud in the Court of <i>Madrid</i> ran through their veines. It
is a common thing amongst them to make a dinner only with a dish of Frixoles in black
broath, boyled with pepper and garlicke, saying it is the most nourishing meat in all
the <i>India's</i>; and after this so stately a dinner they will be sure to come out to the street-dore
of their houses to see and to be seen, and there for halfe an houre will they stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
shaking off the crums of bread from their cloaths, bands (but especially from their
ruffes when they used them) and from their mustachoes. And with their tooth-pickers
they will stand picking their teeth, as if some small Partridge bone stuck in them;
nay if a friend passe by at that time, they will be sure to find out some crum or other
in their mustacho (as if on purpose the crums of the table had been shaken upon their
beards, that the losse of them might be a gaining of credit for great house keeping)
and they will be sure to vent out some non-truth, as to say, <i>A Senor que linda perdiz
he comido oy,</i> O Sir, what a dainty Partridge have I eat to day, where as they picke
out nothing from their teeth but a black husk of a dry frixole or Turkey bean. Though
great in blood and in birth they say they are, yet in their imployments they are but
rich Grasiers, for most of their wealth consisteth in farmes of Cattell and Mules.
Some indeed have Townes of <i>Indians</i> subject unto them, whereof they are called Encomendero's,
and receive yeerly from every <i>Indian</i> a certaine Pole tribute of fowles
and mony. They have most cowardly spirits for warre, and though they will say,
they would faine see <i>Spaine</i>, yet they dare not venture their lives at sea; they judge
sleeping in a whole skin the best maxime for their Criolian spirits. One hundred fighting
souldiers would easily lay low those <i>Chiapa Dons</i>, and gain the whole City, which
lyeth so open to the fields, that the Mules and Asses come in and grase, the streets being
very commodious to entertain Asses from within, and from without. Yet in this City liveth
commonly a Governour, or Alcalde Major, and a Bishop. The Governours place is
of no small esteem and interest, for that his power reacheth farre, and he tradeth much
in Cacao and Cochinil, and domineers over both <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i> at his will and
pleasure. But ill gotten goods never thrive, as was seen in <i>Don Gabriel de Orellana</i>
(Governour of this City and Countrey in my time) who having sent the worth of
eight thousand crownes in Cochinil, Cacao, Sugar, and Hydes by the river of <i>Tabasco</i>
towards the <i>Havana</i> lost it all into the hands of the <i>Hollanders</i>, who doubtlesse knew
how to make better use of it, then would have done that tyrannizing Governour. The
Bishops place of that City is worth at least eight thousand duckats a yeer, which truly he
had need of that comes so far from <i>Spain</i> to live in such a City where are such able <i>Dons</i>,
as <i>Don Melchor de Velasco</i>, and where Asses are so freely fed and bred. Most of this Bishops
revenues consisteth in great offerings which he yeerly receiveth from the great <i>Indian</i>
Townes, going out to them once a yeer to confirme their children, whose confirmation
is such a means to confirme and strengthen the Bishops revenues, that none
must be confirmed by him who offer not a faire white Wax-candle, with a ribban and
at least foure Rials. I have seen the richer sort offer him a Candle of at least six pound
weight with two yards of twelve penny broad ribban, and the Candle stucke from
the top to the bottom with single Rials round about. Nay the poore <i>Indians</i> make it
the chiefe masterpiece of their vanity to offer proudly in such occasions. <i>Don Bernardino
de Salazar</i> was the Bishop of this City in my time, who desired my company to
ride with him his circuit but one moneth, about the Townes neer to <i>Chiapa</i>, and in this
time I was appointed by him to hold the basin wherein the <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>
(whilst he confirmed their children) did cast their offerings, which my selfe and another
Chaplaine did alwaies tell and cast up by good account before we carried the
mony up into his chamber, and I found that at our returne at the moneths end he had
received one thousand and six hundred duckats of onely offerings, besides the fees
due to him for visiting the severall companies, or sodalities and confraternities belonging
to the Saints or soules in their purgatory (which are extraordinary rich there)
whereof he and all other Bishops in their district take account yeerly. This Bishop was
(as all the rest are there) somewhat covetous; but otherwise a man of a temperate
life and conversation, very zealous to reforme whatsoever abuses committed in the
Church, which cost him his life before I departed from <i>Chiapa</i> to <i>Guatemala</i>. The women
of that City it seems pretend much weakenesse and squeamishnesse of stomack,
which they say is so great, that they are not able to continue in the Church while a
Masse is briefly hudled over, much lesse while a solemn high Masse (as they call it) is sung,
and a Sermon preached, unlesse they drinke a cup of hot Chocolatte, and eat a bit of
sweet-meats to strengthen their stomackes. For this purpose it was much used by them
to make their maids bring to them to Church in the middle of Masse or Sermon a cup
of Chocolatte, which could not be done to all, or most of them without a great
confusion and interrupting both Masse and Sermon. The Bishop perceiving this abuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and having given faire warning for the omitting of it, but all without amendment,
thought fit to fixe in writing upon the Churches dores an excommunication against all
such as should presume at the time of service to eat or drinke within the Church. This
excommunication was taken by all, but especially by the Gentlewomen much to heart,
who protested if they might not eat or drinke in the Church, they could not continue
in it to heare what otherwise they were bound unto. The chiefe of them knowing
what great friendship there was between the Bishop and the Prior, and my selfe, came
to the Prior and mee desiring us to use all meanes wee could with the Bishop for
the revoking that his excommunication so heavily laid upon them, and threatning their
soules with damning judgement for the violation of it. The good Prior and my selfe
laboured all we could, alleadging the custome of the Countrey, the weakenesse of the
sex whom it most concerned, and also the weaknesse of their stomackes, the contempt
that might from them ensue unto his person, and many inconveniences which might
follow to the breeding of an uproar in the church and in the City, whereof we had some
probable conjecture from what already we had heard from some. But none of these
reasons would move the Bishop; to which he answered that he preferred the honour of
God, and of his house before his owne life. The women seeing him so hard to be intreated,
began to stomacke him the more and to sleight him with scornefull and reproachfull
words; others sleighted his excommunication, drinking in iniquity in the
Church, as the fish doth water, which caused one day such an uproare in the Cathedrall,
that many swords were drawne against the Preists and Prebends, who attempted
to take away from the maids the cups of Chocolatte, which they brought
unto their mistresses; who at last seeing that neither faire nor foule meanes would prevaile
with the Bishop, resolved to forsake the Cathedrall, where the Bishops own and
his Prebends eies must needs be watching over them; and so from that time most of
the City betooke themselves to the Cloister Churches, where by the Nuns and Friers
they were not troubled nor resisted, though fairely counselled to obey the command
of the Bishop; whose name now they could not brooke, and to whose Prebends they
denied now all such reliefe and stipend for Masses which formerly they had used to bestow
upon them, conferring them all upon the Fryers who grew rich by the poor impoverished
Cathedrall. This lasted not long, but the Bishop began to stomacke the
Fryers, and to set up another excommunication, binding all the City to resort unto
their owne Cathedrall Church; which the women would not obey, but kept their
houses for a whole month; in which time the Bishop fell dangerously sick, and desired
to retire himselfe to the Cloister of the Dominicans, for the great confidence he had in
the Prior that he would take care of him in his sickenesse. Physitians were sent for far
and neere, who all with a joynt opinion agreed that the Bishop was poisoned; and he
himself doubted not of it at his death, praying unto God to forgive those that had been
the cause of it, and to accept of that sacrifice of his life, which he was willing to offer
for the zeale of Gods house and honour. He lay not above a week in the Cloister,
and as soone as he was dead, all his body, his head and face did so swell, that the least
touch upon any part of him caused the skin to break and cast out white matter, which
had corrupted and overflowne all his body. A Gentlewoman with whom I was well
acquainted in that City, who was noted to be somewhat too familiar with one of
the Bishops Pages, was commonly censured to have prescribed such a cup of Chocolatte
to be ministred by the Page which poysoned him who so rigorously had forbidden
Chocolatte to be drunk in the Church. My self heard this Gentlewoman say of the deceased
Bishop, that she thought few grieved for his death, &amp; that the women had no reason
to grieve for him, and that she judged, he being such an enemy to Chocolatte in the
Church, that which he had drunk at home in his house had not agreed with his body.
And it became afterwards a Proverbe in that Country, Beware of the Chocolatte of
<i>Chiapa</i>; which made me so cautious, that I would not drinke afterwards of it in any
house, where I had not very great satisfaction of the whole Family. The women of
this City are somewhat light in their carriage, and have learned from the Devill many
entising lessons and baits to draw poore soules to sinne and damnation; and if they cannot
have their wills, they wil surely work revenge either by Chocolatte or Conserves, or
some faire present, which shall surely carry death along with it. The Gentlewoman
that was suspected (nay was questioned for the death of the Bishop) had often used to
send me boxes of Chocolatte or conserves; which I willingly received from her, judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
it to be a kind of gratuity for the paines I tooke in teaching her son <i>Latin</i>. She was
of a very merry and pleasant disposition, which I thought might consist without sin;
untill one day she sent unto mee a very faire plantin wrapped up in a hankerchief, buried
in sweet Jazmines and roses; when I untied the handkerchief, I thought among the
flowers I should find some rich token, or some peeces of eight, but finding nothing but
a plantin, I wondred; and looking further upon it, I found worked upon it with a
knife the fashion of a heart with two of blind Cupids arrows sticking in it, discovering
unto my heart the poisoned heart and thoughts of the poisoner that sent it. I thought
it a good warning to be wary and cautious of receiving more presents or Chocolatte
from such hands, and so returned unto her againe her plantin with this short rhyme cut
out with a knife upon the skinne <i>fruta tan fria, amor no cria</i>, as much as to say, fruit
so cold, takes no hold. This answer and resolution of mine was soone spread over
that little City, which made my Gentlewoman outragious, which presently she shewed
by taking away her sonne from schoole, and in many meetings threatning to play me
a <i>Chiapaneca</i> tricke. But I remembred the Bishops Chocolatte and so was wary, and staid
not long after in that poisoning and wicked City, which truly deserves no better relation
then what I have given of the simple <i>Dons</i>, and the Chocolatte-confectioning
<i>Donna's</i>.</p>

<p>There is yet twelve leagues from this City of <i>Chiapa</i>, another <i>Chiapa</i> which deserveth
better commendations. This consisteth most of <i>Indians</i>, and is held to be one of the
biggest <i>Indian</i> Townes in all <i>America</i>, containing at least four thousand families. This
Towne hath many priviledges from the King of <i>Spain</i>, and is governed chiefly by <i>Indians</i>
(yet with subordination unto the <i>Spanish</i> government of the City of <i>Chiapa</i>)
who doe choose an <i>Indian</i> Governour with other inferiour officers to rule with him.
This Governour may wear a rapier and dagger, and enjoyeth many other liberties
which to the rest of the <i>Indians</i> are denied. No Towne hath so many <i>Dons</i> in it of <i>Indian</i>
blood as this. <i>Don Philip de Guzman</i> was Governour of it in my time, a very rich
<i>Indian</i>, who kept up commonly in his stable a dozen of as good Horses for publike
shewes, and ostentation as the best <i>Spaniard</i> in the Countrey. His courage was not
inferiour to any <i>Spaniard</i>, and for defence of some priviledges of his Town sued in the
Chancery of <i>Guatemala</i> the proud and high minded Governour of the City of <i>Chiapa</i>,
spending therein great sums of money till he had overcome him, whereupon he caused
a feast to be made in the Towne, both by water and land, so stately, that truly in the
Court of <i>Madrid</i> it might have been acted.</p>

<p>This Towne lyeth upon a great river, whereunto belong many boats and Canoas,
wherein those <i>Indians</i> have been taught to act sea-fights, with great dexterity, and
to represent the Nymphes of <i>Parnassus, Neptune, Æolus</i>, and the rest of the heathenish
Gods and Goddesses, so that they are a wonder of their whole nation. They will arme
with their boats a siege against the Town, fighting against it with such courage til they
make it yeeld, as if they had been trained up all their life to sea-fights. So likewise
within the Town they are as dexterous at baiting of buls, at <i>juego de Cannas</i>, at Horse-races,
at arming a Campe, at all manner of <i>Spanish</i> dances, instruments, and musick
as the best <i>Spaniards</i>. They will erect Towers and Castles made of wood and painted
cloth, &amp; from them fight either with the boats or one against another, with squibs,
darts, and many strange fire-works, so manfully, that if in earnest they could perform
it as well as they do it in sport and pastime, the <i>Spaniards</i> and Fryers might soon
repent to have taught them what they have. As for acting of playes, this is a common
part of their solemne pastimes; and they are so generous, that they nothing think too
much to spend in banquets &amp; sweet-meats upon their Friers, and neighbouring Towns,
whensoever they are minded to shew themselves in a publike feast. The Towne is very
rich, &amp; many <i>Indians</i> in it that trade about the Country as the <i>Spaniards</i> do. They have
learned most trades befitting a Common-wealth, and practise and teach them within
their Town. They want not any provision of fish or flesh, having for the one that great
river joyning unto their Towne, and for the other many Estantia's (as they call them)
or farmes abounding with cattell. In this Towne the Dominican Fryers bear all the
sway, who have a rich and stately Cloister with another Church or Chappel subordinate
unto it. The heat here is so great, that both Fryers and <i>Indians</i> commonly wear a
linnen towel about their necks to wipe off the constant swet from their laces, which maketh
the Friers sit longer at their dinner then els they would do, for that at every bit they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
eate, and draught they drinke, they are faine to make a stop to wipe their dropping
browes. Yet the evenings are fresh and cool, which are much made of there, and spent
in the many walkes and gardins which joyne close unto the River side. Two or three
leagues from the Towne, there are two <i>Ingenio's</i> or Farmes of Sugar, the one belonging
to the Cloister of the Dominicans of the City of <i>Chiapa</i>; the other unto the Cloister
of this Towne, which containe neer two hundred Blackmores, besides many <i>Indians</i>,
who are imployed in that constant worke of making Sugar for all the Country.
Hereabouts are bread great store of Mules, and excellent horses for any service.
The Towne of <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, and all the Townes about it want nothing but a
more temperate climate and cooler aire, and Wheat, which there cannot bee sowne,
yet for <i>Spaniards</i> and such as cannot live without it, it is brought from <i>Chiapa</i> of the
<i>Spaniards</i> and from about <i>Comitlan</i>; yet this is not generally acknowledged a want by
reason of the great plenty of <i>Maiz</i> which all the Townes enjoy, and which is now
more used both by <i>Spaniards</i> and dainty toothed Fryers then bread of Wheat.
Yet your poore <i>Spaniards</i>, and some <i>Indians</i> who have got the trick of trading from
them doe gaine not a little in bringing to these Townes bisquets of wheaten bread,
which though it be dry and hard, yet because they are novelties to the <i>Indians</i>; they get
by changing them for other commodities, especially of Cotton wooll, which here is
more abounding then in the Valley of <i>Copanabastlau</i>.</p>

<p>Upon this Country of <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i> bordereth the Province of <i>Zoques</i>, which
is absolutely the richest part of <i>Chiapa</i>. This reacheth on the one side to <i>Tabasco</i>,
and by the River named <i>Grijalva</i> sendeth commonly the Commodities which are in it
with safety unto St. <i>John de Ulhua</i>, or <i>Vera Cruz</i>. It trafiqueth also with the Country
of <i>Jucatan</i> by the Haven called <i>Puerto Real</i>, which lyeth betweene <i>Grijalva</i> and <i>Jucatan</i>.
Yet these two, the River of <i>Tabasco, alias Grijalva</i>, and <i>Puerto Real</i>, though they
bee commodious to this Province of <i>Zoques</i>, yet they are causes of daily feares unto
the <i>Spaniards</i>, who well know the weaknesse of them, and that if a forraine Nation
should manfully thrust into that Country by any of these two wayes, they might so
conquer all <i>Chiapa</i>, and from thence passe easily unto <i>Guatemala</i>. But the River of <i>Tabasco</i>
lying low, and being somewhat hot, and the Towns about it infested with many
gnats, and the chiefest commodity there being but <i>Cacao</i>, have often discouraged both our
<i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i>, who have come up some part of the River, and minding more the
foresaid reasons, then what was forward to bee had, have turned back, losing a rich
Country and slighting an eternall name, for few and frivolous present difficulties. In
this Province of <i>Zoques</i>, the Towns are not very bigge, yet they bee very rich; the chief
Commodities are Silk and <i>Cochinill</i>; whereof the latter is held the best of <i>America</i>, and
the store of it so great that no one Province alone exceeds it. Few <i>Indians</i> there are who
have not their Orchards planted with the trees whereon the worms breed which yeeld
unto us that rich Commodity; not that the <i>Indians</i> themselves esteem otherwise of it,
then as they see the <i>Spaniards</i> greedy after it, offering them mony for it, &amp; forcing them
to the preservation of it in those parts, which have proved most successeful for this kind.
There is great store of silk in this Country, in so much that the <i>Indians</i> make it their
great Commodity to imploy their wives in working Towels with all colours of silk,
which the <i>Spaniards</i> buy, and send into <i>Spain</i>. It is rare to see what works those
<i>Indian</i> women will make in silk, such as might serve for Patterns and samplers to many
School-mistresses in <i>England</i>. The people of this Country are witty, and ingenious,
and faire of complexion; the Country towards <i>Tabasco</i> is hot, but within in
some places very cold. There is also plenty of <i>Maiz</i>, but no wheat; neither is there
such plenty of Cattell as about <i>Chiapa</i>, but Fowles and Turkies as many as in other
parts. The Province called <i>Zeldales</i> lyeth behind this of the <i>Zoques</i>, from the North
Sea within the continent, running up towards <i>Chiapa</i>, and reacheth in some parts neer to
the borders of <i>Comitlan</i> north-westward. South-eastward it joyns to such <i>Indians</i> which
as yet have not been conquered by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who make many invasions upon the
Christian <i>Indians</i>, and burn their Towns, and carry away their Cattell. The chief and
head Town in this Province is called <i>Ococingo</i>, which is a Frontier against those Heathens.
This Province is esteemed rich for the <i>Spaniards</i>, who make much of <i>Cacao</i>, which serveth
to make their drink of <i>Chocolatte</i>, and here is great store of it. There is also another Commodity,
great among the <i>Spaniards</i>, called <i>Achiotte</i>, wherewith they make their <i>Chocolatte</i>
looke of the colour of a brick. Here is also plenty of Hogs and Bacon, Fowles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Turkies, Quailes, Cattell, Sheep, Maiz, Hony, and not farre from <i>Ococingo</i>, in my time
was setting up an <i>Ingenio</i>, or Farm of Sugar, which was thought would prove as well as
those about <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>. The Country in most parts is high and hilly; but
<i>Ococingo</i> stands in a pleasant Valley, injoying many Brookes and streams of fresh water,
and therefore hath been thought a fit place for Sugar. Here also in this Valley the
fryers have attempted to sow Wheat, which hath proved very good. Thus Reader, I
have shewed you the Country of <i>Chiapa</i>, which as it is compassed about on the one
side by <i>Soconuzco</i>, and from thence almost to <i>Guatemala</i>, by the Province of <i>Suchutepeques</i>,
on the other side by <i>Tabasco</i>, and on the other side by <i>Zeldales</i> with excessive plenty of
<i>Cacao</i> and <i>Achiotte</i>, which are the chief drugs for the making of <i>Chocolatte</i>; I wil yet before
I depart from <i>Chiapa</i> to <i>Guatemala</i>, say somewhat of that drinke so much used by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and in my judgment not to be sleighted, but rather to bee published and made
known to all Nations, whose use might remedy the great abuse of wines and strong
drinks which too much are esteemed amongst us here in <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XVI" id="CHAP_XVI">CHAP. XVI.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Concerning two daily and common Drinkes, or Potions much used in the</i>
India's, <i>called Chocolatte, and Atolle.</i></h4>


<p>Chocolatte being this day used not onely over all the <i>West-India's</i>, but also in
<i>Spain, Italy</i>, and <i>Flanders</i>, with approbation of many learned Doctors in
Physick, among whom <i>Antonio Colmenero</i> of <i>Ledesma</i>; (who lived once in the
<i>India's</i>) hath composed a learned and curious Treatise concerning the nature
and quality of this drink; I thought fit to insert here also somewhat of it concerning my
own experience for the space of twelve yeers. This name Chocolatte is an <i>Indian</i> name,
and is compounded from Atte, as some say or as others, Atle, which in the <i>Mexican</i> language
signifieth water, &amp; from the sound which the water (wherein is put the Chocolatte)
makes, as Choco, Choco, Choco, when it is stirred in a cup by an instrument called a
Molinet, or Molinillo, untill it bubble and rise unto a froath. And as there it is a name
compounded, so in <i>English</i> wee may well call it a compounded or a confectioned drink
wherein are found many and severall Ingredients, according to the different disposition
of the body of them that use it. But the chief Ingredient (without which it cannot be
made) is called Cacao, a kind of nut or kernell bigger then a great Almond, which
growes upon a tree called the tree of Cacao, and ripens in a great huske, wherein
sometimes are found more, sometimes lesse Cacao's, sometimes twenty, sometimes thirty,
nay forty, and above. This Cacao, though as every simple, it containes the quality
of the foure Elements, yet in the common opinion of most Physitians, it is held to
bee cold and dry, <i>a prædominio</i>; It is also in the substance that rules these two qualities,
restringent and obstructive, of the nature of the Element of the earth. And as it is thus
a mixed, and not a simple Element, it hath parts correspondent to the rest of the Elements;
and particularly it partakes of those which correspond with the Element of
Aire, that is, heat and moisture, which are governed by unctious parts; there being
drawn out of the Cacao much Butter, which in the <i>India's</i> I have seen drawn out of it
by the Criolian women for to oint their faces. And let not this seeme impossible to
believe, that this graine or nut of Cacao should bee said to bee first cold and dry,
and then hot and moist; for though experience bee a thousand witnesses, yet instances
will further clear this truth; and first in the Rubarbe, which hath in it hot and
soluble parts, and parts which are binding, cold and dry, which have a virtue to
strengthen, bind and stop the loosenesse of the belly. Secondly, wee see this cleerly
in the steel, which having so much of the nature of the earth, as being heavy, thick, cold,
and dry, should be thought unproper for the curing of Oppilations, but rather to bee
apt to increase them; and yet it is given for a proper remedy against them. The authority
of <i>Galen</i> may further cleare this in the third booke of the Qualities of simples,
where hee teacheth that almost all those medicines, which to our sense seeme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to be simple, are notwithstanding naturally compounded, containing in themselves
contrary qualities, that is to say, a quality to expell, and to retaine, to incrassate and
to extenuate, to rarifie and to condense. And in the fifteenth Chapter following in
the same booke, he puts an example of the broth of a Cock, which moves the belly, and
the flesh hath the virtue to binde. Yet further that this differing virtue and quality is
found in divers substances, or parts of simple medicaments, he shewes in the first book
of his simple medicines in the seventeenth Chapter, bringing the example of milke, in
which three substances are found and separated, that is to say, the substance of cheese,
which hath the virtue to stop the fluxe of the belly; and the substance of whay, which
is purging, and butter, as it is expressed Chap. 15. Also we find in wine which is in
the Must, three substances, that is to say, earth, which is the chiefe; and a thinner substance,
which is the flower, and may be called the scum, or froath; and a third substance
which we properly call wine; and every one of these substances containes in it
selfe divers qualities and virtues, in the colour, in the smell, and in other accidents.</p>

<p>And this is very comformable to reason, if we consider that every aliment, be it never
so simple, begets and produceth in the liver four humours, not only differing in temper,
but also in substance; and begets more or lesse of that humour, according as the
aliment hath more or fewer parts corresponding to the substance of that humour,
which is most ingendred. From which examples we may gather that when the Cacao
is grinded and stirred, the divers parts, which nature hath given it, doe artificially and
intimately mixe themselves one with another; and so the unctuous, warme, and moist
parts, mingled with the earthy represseth, and leaveth them not so binding, as they were
before; but rather with a mediocrity, more inclining to the warme, and moist temper
of the aire, then to the cold and dry of the earth; as it doth appear, when it is made
fit to drink, that scarce two turnes are given with the Molinet, when there ariseth a fatty
scum, by which is seen, how much it partaketh of the oyly part. So that from all that
hath been said, the error of those is wel discovered, who speaking of this drink of Chocolatte,
say, that it causeth oppilations, because Cacao is astringent; as if that astriction
were not corrected and modified by the intimate mixing of one part with another, by
meanes of the grinding, as is said before. Besides it having so many ingredients, which
are naturally hot, it must of necessity have this effect, that is to say, to open, attenuate,
and not to binde. And leaving aside more reasons, this truth is evidently seen in the
Cacao it selfe; which if it be not stirred, grinded and compounded to make the Chocolatte;
but be eaten as it is in the fruit (as many Criolian and <i>Indian</i> women eat it)
it doth notably obstruct and cause stoppings, and make them looke of a broken, pale
and earthy colour, as doe those that eat earthen ware, as pots, or pieces of
lime-walls (which is much used among the <i>Spanish</i> women thinking that pale
and earthy colour, though with obstructions and stoppings, well becomes them) and
for this certainly in the Cacao thus eaten there is no other reason, but that the divers
substances which it containes, are not perfectly mingled by the mastication onely, but
require the artificiall mixture, which wee have spoken of before.</p>

<p>The tree which doth beare this fruit, is so delicate, and the earth where it groweth
so extream hot, that to keep the tree from being consumed by the sunne, they first
plant other trees, which they call, <i>las Madres del Cacao</i>, mothers of the Cacao; and
when these are grown up to a good height fit to shade the Cacao trees, then they plant
the Cacaotals, or the trees of Cacao; that when they first shew themselves above the
ground, those trees, which are already grown may shelter them, and as mothers nourish,
defend, and shadow them from the sunne; and the fruit doth not grow naked,
but many of them (as I have said before) are in one great huske or cod, and therein
besides every grain is closed up in a white juicy skin, which the women also love to suck
off from the Cacao, finding it coole, and in the mouth dissolving into water. There
are two sorts of Cacao; the one is common, which is of a darke colour inclining towards
red, being round and peeked at the ends; the other is broader, and bigger, and
flatter, and not so round, which they call, Patlaxte, and this is white, and more drying,
and is sold a great deal cheaper then the former. And this especially, more then the
other, causeth watchfullnesse, and drives away sleep, and therefore is not so usefull as
the ordinary, and is chiefly spent by the ordinary and meaner sort of people. As for
the rest of the ingredients which make this Chocolatticall confection, there is notable
variety; for some put into it black Pepper, which is not well approved of by the Physitians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
because it is so hot and dry, but onely for one who hath a very cold liver; but
commonly instead of this Pepper, they put into it long red Pepper, called Chile, which
though it be hot in the mouth, yet is cool and moist in the operation. It is further
compounded with white Sugar, Cinnamon, Clove, Anniseed, Almonds, Hasell-nuts,
<i>Orejuela, Bainilla, Sapayoll</i>, Orenge flower water, some Muske, and as much of
Achiotte, as will make it looke of the colour of a red bricke. But how much of each
of these may be applyed to such a quantity of Cacao, the severall dispositions of mens
bodies must be their rule. The ordinary receipt of <i>Antonio Colmenero</i> was this; To every
hundred Cacao's, two cods of Chile, called long red Pepper, one handfull of
Anniseed and <i>Orejuela's</i>, and two of the flowers called <i>Mechasuchil</i>, or <i>Bainilla</i>, or instead
of this six roses of <i>Alexandria</i>, beat to powder, two drams of Cinnamon, of
Almonds and Hasel-nuts, of each one dozen; of white Sugar halfe a pound, of Achiotte,
enough to give it the colour. This Author thought neither Clove, nor Musk,
nor any sweet water fit, but in the <i>India's</i> they are much used. Others use to put in
Maiz, or <i>Paniso</i>, which is very windy; but such doe it onely for their profit, by increasing
the quantity of the Chocolatte; because every fanega or measure of Maiz containing
about a bushel and a half, is sold for eight shillings, and they that sell Chocolatte,
sell it for four shillings a pound, which is the ordinary price. The Cinnamon is held
one of the best ingredients, and denied by none, for that it is hot and dry in the third
degree, it provokes urine, and helpes the kidneys and reines of those who are troubled
with cold diseases, and it is good for the eyes, and in effect it is cordiall, as appeareth by
the Author of these verses,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Commoda &amp; urinæ Cinamomum &amp; renibus affert,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><i>Lumina clarificat, dira venena fugat.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>The <i>Achiotte</i> hath a piercing, attenuating quality, as appeareth by the common practice
of the Physitians in the <i>India's</i>, experienced daily in the effects of it, who do give it to
their Patients to cut and attenuate the grosse humors, which doe cause shortnesse of
breath, and stopping of urine: and so it is used for any kind of oppilations, and is
given for the stoppings which are in the breast, or in the region of the belly, or any other
part of the body. This <i>Achiotte</i> also groweth upon a tree in round huskes, which are full
of red graines, from whence the <i>Achiotte</i> is taken, and first made into a paste, and then
being dried up is fashioned either into round balls or cakes, or into the forme of little
brickes, and so is sold. As concerning the long red Pepper, there are foure sorts of it;
one is called <i>Chilchotes</i>; the other is very little, which they call <i>Chilterpin</i>, and these
two kinds are very quick and biting. The other two are called, <i>Tonalchiles</i>, and these
are but moderately hot, for they are eaten with bread by the <i>Indians</i>, as they eat other
fruits. But that which is usually put into Chocolatte, is called <i>Chilpaclagua</i>, which
hath a broad huske, and is not so biting as the first, nor so gentle as the last. The <i>Mechasuchil</i>,
or <i>Bainilla</i> hath a purgative quality. All these ingredients are usually put
into the Chocolatte, and by some more, according to their fancies. But the meaner sort
of people, as <i>Blackmores</i> and <i>Indians</i>, commonly put nothing into it, but <i>Cacao, Achiotte,
Maiz</i>, and a few <i>Chiles</i> with a little Anniseed. And though the <i>Cacao</i> is mingled with
all these ingredients, which are hot; yet there is to be a greater quantity of <i>Cacao</i>, then
of all the rest of the ingredients, which serve to temper the coldnesse of the <i>Cacao</i>; from
whence it followeth that this Chocolatticall confection is not so cold as the <i>Cacao</i>, nor
so hot as the rest of the ingredients, but there results from the action and reaction of
these ingredients, a moderate temper, which may be good, both for the cold and hot
stomacks, being taken moderately.</p>

<p>Now for the making or compounding of this drinke, I shall set downe here the
method. The Cacao, and the other ingredients must be beaten in a morter of stone,
or (as the <i>Indians</i> use) ground upon a broad stone, which they call <i>Metate</i>, and is only
made for that use. But first the ingredients are all to be dried, except the <i>Achiotte</i>, with
care that they may be beaten to powder, keeping them still in stirring, that they be
not burnt, or become black; for if they be overdried, they will be bitter, and lose
their virtue. The Cinnamon and the long red pepper are to be first beaten, with the
Anniseed, and then the Cacao, which must be beaten by little and little, till it be all powdred;
and in the beating it must be turned round, that it may mixe the better. Every
one of these ingredients must be beaten by it selfe, and then all be put into the vessell,
where the Cacao is, which you must stirre together with a spoon, and then take out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
paste, and put it into the morter, under which there must be a little fire, after the confection
is made; but if more fire be put under then will only warme it, then the unctuous
part will dry away. The <i>Achiotte</i> also must be put in in the beating, that it may the
better take the colour. All the ingredients must be searsed, save onely the Cacao, and
if from the Cacao the dry shell be taken, it will be the better. When it is well beaten,
and incorporated (which will be known by the shortnesse of it) then with a spoon (so
in the <i>India's</i> is used) is taken up some of the paste, which will be almost liquid, and
made into tablets, or else without a spoon put into boxes, and when it is cold it will be
hard. Those that make it into tablets, put a spoonefull of the paste upon a peece of
paper (the <i>Indians</i> put it upon the leaf of a plantin tree) where, being put into the shade
(for in the sunne it melts and dissolves) it growes hard; and then bowing the paper or leaf,
the tablet falls off, by reason of the fatnesse of the paste. But if it be put into
anything of earth, or wood, it stickes fast, and will not come off, but with scraping
or breaking. The manner of drinking it, is divers; the one (being the way
most used in <i>Mexico</i>) is to take it hot with Atolle, dissolving a tablet in hot water, and
then stirring and beating it in the cup, where it is to be drunke, with a Molinet, and
when it is well stirred to a scumme or froath, then to fill the cup with hot Atolle and
so drinke it sup by sup. Another way is, that the Chocolatte, being dissolved with
cold water and stirred with the Molinet, and the scumme taken off and put into another
vessel; the remainder be set upon the fire, with as much sugar as will sweeten it, and
when it is warme, then to powre it upon the scum which was taken off before, and so
to drinke it. But the most ordinary way, is, to warme the water very hot, and then
to powre out halfe the cup full that you mean to drinke; and to put into it a tablet or
two, or as much as will thicken reasonably the water, and then grind it well with the
Molinet, and when it is well ground and risen to a scum, to fill the cup with hot water,
and so drinke it by sups (having sweetned it with Sugar) and to eat it with a little
conserve, or maple bread, steeped into the Chocolatte. Besides these waies there is another
way (which is much used in the Island of <i>Santo Domingo</i>) which is, to put the
Chocolatte into a pipkin, with a little water, and to let it boyle well till it be dissolved,
and then to put in sufficient water and sugar according to the quantity of the
Chocolatte, and then to boyle it againe, untill there comes an oily scumme upon it,
and then to drinke it. There is another way yet to drinke Chocolatte, which is cold,
which the <i>Indians</i> use at feasts, to refresh themselves, and it is made after this manner.
The Chocolatte (which is made with none or very few ingredients) being dissolved
in cold water with the Molinet, they take off the scumme or crassy part, which riseth
in great quantity, especially when the Cacao is older and more putrefied. The
scumme they lay aside in a little dish by it selfe, and then put sugar into that part from
whence was taken the scum, and then powre it from on high into the scumme, and so
drinke it cold. And this drinke is so cold, that it agreeth not with all mens stomacks;
for by experience it hath been found, that it doth hurt, by causing pains in the stomack,
especially to women. The third way of taking it is the most used, and thus certainly
it doth no hurt, neither know I why it may not bee used as well in <i>England</i> as in other
parts both hot and cold; for where it is so much used, the most, if not all, as well
in the <i>India's</i>, as in <i>Spaine, Italy, Flanders</i> (which is a cold Countrey) find that it agreeth
well with them. True it is, it is used more in the <i>India's</i>, then in the <i>European</i>
parts, because there the stomackes are more apt to faint then here, and a cup of Chocolatte
well confectioned comforts and strengthens the stomack. For my self I must
say, I used it twelve yeers constantly, drinking one cup in the morning, another yet
before dinner between nine or ten of the clock; another within an houre or two after
dinner, and another between four and five in the afternoon; and when I was purposed
to sit up late to study, I would take another cup about seven or eight at night, which
would keep me waking till about midnight. And if by chance I did neglect any of
these accustomed houres, I presently found my stomacke fainty. And with this custome
I lived twelve yeers in those parts healthy, without any obstructions, or oppilations,
not knowing what either ague, or feaver was. Yet I will not dare to regulate by mine
owne the bodies of others, nor take upon me the skil of a Physitian, to appoint and
define at what time and by what persons this drinke may be used. Onely I say, I have
known some that have been the worse for it, either for drinking it with too much sugar,
which hath relaxed their stomackes, or for drinking it too often. For certainly if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
be drunke beyond measure, not only this Chocolatte but all other drinkes, or meats,
though of themselves they are good and wholesome, they may be hurtfull. And if
some have found it oppilative, it hath come by the too too much use of it; as when
one drinkes overmuch wine, instead of comforting and warming himselfe, he breeds
and nourisheth cold diseases, because nature cannot overcome it, not turne so great
a quantity into good nourishment. So he that drinkes much Chocolatte, which hath
fat parts, cannot make distribution of so great a quantity to all the parts; and that
part which remaines in the slender veines of the liver must needs cause oppilations and
obstructions. But lastly, to conclude with this <i>Indian</i> drinke, I will adde what I have
heard Physitians of the <i>India's</i> say of it, and have seen it by experience in others
(though never I could find it in my selfe) that those that use this Chocolatte much,
grow fat and corpulent by it; which indeed may seem hard to beleeve; for considering
that all the ingredients, except the Cacao, doe rather extenuate, then make fat,
because they are hot and dry in the third degree. And we have already said, that the
qualities which doe predominate in Cacao, are cold and dry, which are very unfit to
adde any substance to the body. Neverthelesse it may be answered that the many unctuous
parts, which have been proved to be in the Cacao, are those which pinguifie and
make fat; and the hotter ingredients of this composition serve for a guide, or vehicall,
to passe to the liver, and the other parts, untill they come to the fleshy parts; and
there finding a like substance which is hot and moist, as is the unctuous part, converting
it selfe into the same substance, it doth augment and pinguifie. But how then might
this Cacao with the other <i>Indian</i> ingredients be had in <i>England</i>? even by trading in
<i>Spaine</i> for it, as we doe for other commodities; or not sleighting it so much as we and
the <i>Hollanders</i> have often done upon the <i>Indian</i> seas; of whom I have heard the <i>Spaniards</i>
say that when we have taken a good prize, a ship laden with Cacao, in anger and
wrath we have hurled over board this good commoditie, not regarding the worth and
goodnesse of it, but calling it in bad <i>Spanish, Cagaruta de Carnero</i>, or sheeps dung in
good <i>English</i>. It is one of the necessariest commodities in the <i>India's</i>, and nothing
enricheth <i>Chiapa</i> in particular more then it, whither are brought from <i>Mexico</i> and other
parts, the rich bags of Patacons onely for this <i>Cagaruta de Carnero</i>, which we
call sheeps dung. The other drinke which is much used in the <i>Indians</i> is called Atolle,
of which I will say but a little, because I know it cannot be used here. This was the
drinke of the ancient <i>Indians</i>, and is a thick pap made of the flower of Maiz, taking
off the huskes from it, which is windy and melancholy. This is commonly carried
by the <i>Indian</i> women to the Markets hot in pots, and there is sold in cups. The
Criolian students, as wee goe to a Taverne to drink a cup of wine, so they go in company
to the publike Markets, and as publikely buy and drinke by measure of this Atolle;
which somtimes is seasoned with a little Chile, or long Pepper, and then it pleaseth
them best. But the Nuns and Gentlewomen have got a trick of confectioning it with
Cinnamon, Sweet-waters, Amber, or Muske, and store of Sugar, and thus it is
held to be a most strong and nourishing drinke, which the Physitians doe prescribe unto
a weake body, as we doe here our Almond-milke. But of what <i>England</i> never knew
nor tasted, I will say no more, but hasten my penne to <i>Guatemala</i>, which hath been my
second <i>patria</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XVII" id="CHAP_XVII">CHAP. XVII.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing my journy from the City of</i> Chiapa, <i>unto</i> Guatemala, <i>and the chief
places in the way.</i></h4>


<p>The time now being come that I was to leave the little City of <i>Chiapa</i>, I took
some occasion before-hand to take my leave of my best friends, whose children
I had taught, and at my departure I must confesse I found them kind and
bountifull, except it were <i>Donna Magdalena de Morales</i>, from whom I did
not expect, neither did I desire any farewell, or Adieu token. But among all, the Governours
wife was most liberall unto mee, sending mee many boxes of Aromaticall Chocolatte,
and one extraordinary great box with foure severall divisions of different conserves
gilt over, besides many Maple breads, and Biskets made with Egs and Sugar, a present
it was which might have been sent to a greater man then to a poor worthlesse Mendicant
Fryer, and with this in a handkerchief a dozen peeces of eight. <i>Don Melchor del
Velazco</i> yet exceeded her, in words and complements I meane, but in deeds, hee and all
the crew of the Criolians must thinke to come short of them, who are borne in <i>Spain</i>.
The first Town I went unto, was <i>Theopixca</i>, six leagues from <i>Chiapa</i>, a faire and great
Towne of <i>Indians</i>, who are held to bee next unto the <i>Indians</i> of the other <i>Chiapa</i> in
sitting and riding a horse. In this town is nothing so considerable as the Church, which
is great and strong, and the musick belonging unto it sweet and harmonious. The Vicar
or Curate of this place was one Fryer <i>Peter Martir</i> a Criolian, whom I knew could
not indure the Prior nor mee, yet he would dissemble a love complementall exceeding
well, and in outward shews raise it up to <i>gradus ut Octo</i>. He knowing my prevalency
with the Prior, durst not but give mee very good entertainment, which continued two
dayes, untill I was weary of his complements.</p>

<p>The third day I tooke my leave of him, who would not yet leave mee, but would
conduct mee to <i>Comitlan</i>, whither I was invited by the Prior of that Cloister, named
Fryer <i>Thome Rocolano</i>, a <i>French</i> man, who being a stranger to the <i>Spaniards</i> (for besides
him and my selfe there was no other stranger in that County) desired acquaintance
with mee, which hee began to settle by meeting mee at the half way with many
<i>Indians</i> on horse back, having provided an harbour where wee might more conveniently
conferre and rest while our Chocolatte and other refreshments were provided.
But the Criolian <i>Peter Martir</i> was not a little envious, (as I was afterwards informed
in the Cloister) to see mee so much made of and esteemed in the Country, yet his
faire words and complements farre exceeded the sincerity and down-rightnesse of my
<i>French</i> friend. At <i>Comitlan</i> I staied a whole weeke, riding about with the Prior unto
the <i>Indian</i> townes, and downe the hill to the valley of <i>Copanabastla</i>, where I injoyed
much pastime and recreation among the Fryers and <i>Indians</i> and was feasted after the
manner of that Country, which knoweth more of an Epicurian diet then doth <i>England</i>,
or any part of <i>Europe</i>; nay I am perswaded (and I have heard <i>Spaniards</i> confesse
it) that <i>Spain</i> hath taken from the <i>Indians</i> since the conquest many lessons for the
dressing of severall dishes and compleating a feast or banquet. After the week was ended
my <i>French</i> friend the Prior conducted mee to <i>Izquintenango</i>, to see mee well furnished
up the Mountaines of <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>. This Towne (as I have formerly observed)
standeth almost at the end of the Valley of <i>Copanabastla</i>, and within two leagues of the
<i>Cuchumatlanes</i>. It is one of the finest <i>Indian</i> Townes of all the Province of <i>Chiapa</i>,
and very rich, by reason of the much Cotton wooll in it, and especially by reason of
its situation, for standing in the Roade way to <i>Guatemala</i>, all the Merchants of the
Country that trade with their mules that way, passe through this Towne, and there
buy and sell, enriching it with mony and farre brought Commodities. It is most plentifully
stored with fruits, especially with what they call Pina's or Pine fruit. It standeth
close by the great River, which runneth to <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, and hath its spring
not farre off from the <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>, and yet at this Town is very broad and deep. No
man nor beast travelling to <i>Guatemala</i> can goe into it, or from <i>Guatemala</i> can goe out of
it, but by ferrying over. And the Rode being much used and beaten by travellers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and by such as they call Requas of mules (every Requa consisting of fifty or threescore
mules) this Ferry is day and night imployed, and yeelds much treasure to the town
at the yeers end. The <i>Indians</i> of the Town besides the ferry boat, have made many
other little boats, or Canoa's to goe up and down the River. Hither when the Prior
of <i>Comitlan</i> had brought me, we were waited for by the Vicar or Fryer of that Town
with the chief and principall <i>Indians</i>, and most of the Canoa's. As we ferryed over,
the little Canoa's went before us with the Quiristers of the Church singing before
us, and with others sounding their Waits and Trumpets. The Fryer that lived in this
Town, was called Fryer <i>Geronymo de Guevara</i>, little in stature, but great in state, pride
and vanity, as hee shewed himself in what hee had provided for us both of fish and
flesh. A brave professour or vower of Mendicancy and poverty he was, who in twelve
yeers that hee had lived in that Towne, what by mumming of Masses for the dead and
living, what by shearing and fleecing the poore <i>Indians</i>, what by trading and traffiquing
with the Merchants that used that Rode, had got six thousand Duckats, which
hee had sent to <i>Spain</i> to the Court of <i>Madrid</i>, to trade with them Simoniacally for the
Bishoprick of <i>Chiapa</i>, which if he obtained not, (yet when I came out of that Country
the report went that hee had obtained it) hee would and was well able with a second
supply to obtaine a better. After two daies feasting with him, hee and the Prior of
<i>Comitlan</i> both joyned their power and authority to see mee well manned with <i>Indians</i>,
to the first Towne of the <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>. A mule was prepared to carry my
bedding, (which wee commonly carried with us in chests of leather called Petaca's)
another <i>Indian</i> to carry my Petaquilla wherein was my Chocolatte and all implements
to make it; and three more <i>Indians</i> to ride before and behinde to guide me; but
to all these nothing was to be paid, (lest a custome of paying should bee brought in,
for so they doctrined mee as a novice in that Country) except it were to give them a
cup of Chocolatte if I drank in the way, or when I came to my journeys end. Here
I tooke my leave of my good <i>French</i> friend, (who yet continued friendship with
mee by frequent letters to <i>Guatemala</i>) and of my low but high minded <i>Guevara</i>, who
bad mee expect no friendly entertainment, untill I were well passed over the <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>
and arrived at <i>Sacapula</i>, which was foure daies journey from thence. Yet hee
told mee I might demand what service I list from the <i>Indians</i>, and call for what I had
a minde to eat without paying any mony, so that I did write down my expences in the
common Town Book.</p>

<p>Thus I went away from my friends somewhat heavy having no other company
but unknowne <i>Indians</i>, leaving a pleasant and delightsome valley behind mee, and
seeing nothing before mee but high and steepy hils and mountaines, and considering
that in foure or five dayes I should see no more gallant Dominicans and of mine own
profession. Now I wished I had the company of my <i>Melendez</i> and other friends, who
were a comfort one to another upon the hills and rocks of <i>Maquilapa</i>. Yet at last
I concluded, up <i>English</i> heart and courage, <i>quondam hæc meminisse juvabit</i>. Though
the mountaines seemed high afar off, yet as I travelled on, I found the way lie between
them very easie and passable, and met now and then Requas of mules, which were
no little comfort unto mee to consider, if they being heavily laden could goe through
those Mountaines, my mule that had in mee but a light burden would easily overcome
any danger; it comforted mee also to consider that there were Townes (though
but little ones) where I might rest every night. The further I went, the better and
more open I found the Rode; Onely the raine and dirt troubled me, which I could
not avoid, it being the end of <i>September</i>, or as there they reckon, the end of winter. The
first Town I came to amongst those Mountaines was called St. <i>Martin</i>, a little place of
some twenty houses; I went to the house that belonged to the Franciscan Fryers (who
seldome in the yeer came to that poverty of house and house roome) where I lighted
and caused the <i>Indians</i> to bee called who were appointed to give attendance to travellers
and passengers. I found them very tractable and dutifull, bidding mee welcome,
bringing mee hot water for my Chocolatte, which I drunke off heartily, and
gave unto my <i>Indians</i> of <i>Izquintenango</i>, who refreshed themselves and their mules well
for nothing, this being a custome among those Townes in the Rode to welcome
one another whensoever they come with travellers. I might have had for my supper
any thing that place would afford, but I made choice of a pullet, which I thought
would bee cheapest for the poore <i>Indians</i>. I was glad I had brought with mee a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
big Frasco, as they call it, or bottle of wine, for I began already to find the <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>
cooler then the valley of <i>Copanabastla</i>. My bed was made in a little thatched Cobe, and
<i>Indian</i> boyes appointed to sleep in the next room to me, and to be at hand if in the night
I should want any thing. Thus having appointed what attendance I had need of in the
morning to the next Town, discharging the <i>Indians</i> that had brought me from <i>Izquintenango</i>,
I went unto my rest, which I tooke as quietly as if I had been in the company
of my best friends. The next day being accompanied by two <i>Indians</i>, having sent
my carriage by another, I tooke my journey to the next Towne, which is called <i>Cuchumatlan
grande</i>, because it standeth on the highest part of those Mountaines, and in
the way the <i>Indians</i>shewed mee the head spring or fountaine of the great River of
<i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, which is the onely remarkable thing in that Rode. <i>Cuchumatlan
grande</i> is a Towne a little bigger then St. <i>Martin</i>, and of <i>Indians</i> very curteous,
who are used and beaten to daily travellers, and so make very much of them. Here
I was entertained as the night before; and found the poore <i>Indians</i> willing to
give mee whatsoever I demanded for my better and safer guiding and conducting the
next day, and that night for my supper what I pleased to call for, without any pay,
but onely writing down my name and expences with the day and moneth in their common
booke of accounts. This are those poore wretches brought to by the Fryers and
commanding Justices, though of themselves they have no more then a Milpa of Maiz
as they terme it, or a little <i>Indian</i> Wheat Plantation, with as much Chile as will suffice
them for the yeer, and what the Merchants and Travellers give them voluntarily, which
is little enough. From this Town I would not follow the Rode to the next, which
was a long journy of seven or eight leagues without baiting by the way; and also because
I had beene informed at <i>Chiapa</i> and at <i>Copanabastla</i> of a strange picture of our
Lady, which was amongst these Mountaines in a little Towne of <i>Indians</i> called <i>Chiantla</i>,
which in this dayes journy being not above a league out of my way, I was resolved to
see. The wayes were bad, lying out of the Rode, yet by noon I got to <i>Chiantla</i>, which is
a Town belonging unto Mercenarian Fryers, who doubtlesse would not be able to subsist
in so poore a place, had they not invented that loadstone of their picture of <i>Mary</i>,
and cried it up for miraculous, to draw people farre and neere, and all travellers from
the Rode to pray unto it, and to leave their gifts and almes unto them for their prayers
and Masses. Such an income of treasure and riches hath beene from deluded and
ignorant soules to this beggerly Towne, that the Fryers have had wherewith to
build a Cloister able to maintaine foure or five of them. The Church is richly furnished,
but especially the high Altar where the picture standeth in a Tabernacle with
half a dozen curtaines of Silk, Sattin, cloth of gold, with borders of golden lace before
it, wearing a rich Crowne of gold, thickly beset with Diamonds and other pretious
stones. There hang before it at least a dozen rich lampes of silver; and in the
vestry of the Church are many gownes, Candlestickes of silver, Censers to burn Frankincense
before it, besides rich Copes, Vestments, Ornaments for the Altar, and hangings
for all the Church.</p>

<p>To conclude, here is a treasure hid in the Mountaines; Oh that it could bee found
out to doe the Lord service. I was welcomed to this place by those Fryers, who were
strangers unto mee; my head was filled that day by them with relations of strange and
many miracles or lies, which they told mee of that picture; but the heavinesse of my
head did mee good in something, for it made mee more drowsie at night and apter to
take good rest. The next day I got into the Rode againe, and went to the last Town
of these <i>Cuchumatlanes</i> called <i>Chautlan</i>, where I stayed all that day and night, and sent
before a letter to the Prior of <i>Sacapula</i> of my going thither the next day. In <i>Chautlan</i>
I was very kindly used by the <i>Indians</i>, and liked the Towne the better for the excellent
grapes which there I found, not planted like vineyards, but growing up in harbours,
which shew that if that land were planted, it would certainly yeeld as good grapes
for wine, as any are in <i>Spain</i>. They are carried from that place to <i>Guatemala</i>, which
stands from it neer forty leagues, and are sold about the streets for rarities and great
dainties; and well may they, for from <i>Mexico</i> to <i>Guatemala</i> there are none like them. The
next morning I made haste to be gone, that I might come sooner to <i>Sacapula</i>, where I
was to finde those of mine owne profession, with whom I knew I might stay and rest a
whole weeke if I pleased. I had not rid above three leagues, when I began to discover
at a low and deep bottome, a pleasant and goodly valley, laced with a River, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
waters receiving the glorious brightnesse of <i>Phoebus</i> beames reverberated up to the top
of the Mountaine, a delightsome prospect to the beholders; the more I hasted to that
seeming Paradise, the more did the twinkling and wanton streame invite mee downe
the hill; which I had no sooner descended, but I found in an harbour by the water side
the Prior of <i>Sacapula</i> himselfe with a good traine of <i>Indians</i> waiting for mee with a
cup of Chocolatte. At the first light I was a little daunted to behold the Prior, who
looked most fearfully with a bladder from his throat swelled almost round his necke,
which hung over his shoulders and brest, and stayed up his chin, and lifted up his
head so, that hee could scarce looke any whither but up to heaven. In our discourse
he told mee that disease had beene upon him at least ten yeers, and that the water of that
River had caused it in him, and in many others of that Town. This made mee now
as much out of love with the River, as above the hill I had liked the goodly sight of
it, and therefore resolved not to stay so long in that place as I had thought, lest
the waters should marke me for all my life, as they had done this Prior; whose name was
Fryer <i>John De la Cruz</i>, a Biscaine borne, and (like some of that Nation) a little troubled
with the simples, but a good hearted man, humble, and well beloved over all the
Country both by <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>. When I came to the Towne I discovered
many men and women with bladders in their throats like the poore Prior, which made
mee almost unwilling to drink there any Chocolatte made with that water, or eat any
thing dressed with it; untill the Prior did much incourage mee and told mee that
it did not hurt all but onely some, and those who did drink it cold; wherewith I resolved
to stay there foure or five daies, because of the old Priors importunity, who
would faine have had mee continue to live with him, promising to teach mee the <i>Indian</i>
language in a very short time. But higher matters calling mee to <i>Guatemala</i>, I
excused my selfe, and continued there five dayes with much recreation. The Town
though it be not in the generall very rich, yet there are some <i>Indian</i> Merchants who
trade about the country and especially to <i>Suchutepeques</i> where is the chief store of Cacao,
and thereby some of this Towne of <i>Sacapula</i>, have inriched themselves; the rest of
the people trade in pots and pans, which they make of an earth there fit for that purpose.
But the principall Merchandize of this place is salt, which they gather in the
morning from the ground that lyeth neere the River. The aire is hot, by reason the
Town standeth low, and compassed with high hills on every side. Besides many good
fruits which are here, there are Dates as good as those that come from <i>Barbary</i>,
and many trees of them in the Garden belonging to the Cloister. After I had here
wearied out the wearinesse, which I brought in my bones from the <i>Cuchumatlanes</i>,
I departed taking my way to <i>Guatemala</i>, and from <i>Sacapula</i> I went to a Town called
St. <i>Andres</i>, or St. <i>Andrews</i>, which standeth six or seven leagues from <i>Sacapula</i>, a great
Town, but nothing remarkable in it, save onely Cotton wooll and Turkies, and about
it some rich Estancia's or Farmes of Cattell, which are commodiously seated here, it
being a plain Champaigne Country. Yet at further end of this plain there is a Mountaine
which discourageth with the sight all such as travell to <i>Guatemala</i>; from St. <i>Andres</i>
I prepared my selfe for the next daies journey, which was of nine long leagues,
to a very great Town called by two names, by some <i>Sacualpa</i>, by others Sta. <i>Maria
Zojabah</i>, to the which I could not goe without passing over that Mountaine. I sent
word of going to <i>Zojabah</i> the day before (as is the custome there) that mules and horses
might meet mee upon the Mountaine; and the night before I went to a Rancho
(which is a lodge built for travellers to rest when the journey is long) which stood
within a league of the Mountaine by a River, where with the waters murmur, and
refreshing gales I tooke good rest. In the morning having refreshed my selfe, and my
<i>Indians</i> with Chocolatte I set out to incounter with that proud Mountaine; and when
I came unto it I found it not so hard to overcome, as I had conceited, the way lying
with windings and turnings; But the higher I mounted the more my eyes were troubled
with looking to the River below, whose rockes were enough to astonish and make
a stout heart tremble. About the middle of the Mountaine the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zojabah</i>
met with a mule for mee, and another for my carriage in a narrow passage where the
way went wheeling. Here I lighted, whilst the <i>Indians</i> helped one another to unload
and load the mule that came of refresh. Out of the narrow way the side of the Mountaine
was steepy, and a fearefull precipice of two or three miles to the bottome, almost
bare of trees, here and there one onely growing. My heart was true unto mee, wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
mee to walke up a foot untill I came unto some broader passage; but the <i>Indians</i> perceiving
my feare told me there was no danger, assuring mee further that the Mule they
had brought was sure, and had been well used to that mountaine. With their perswasions
I got up, but no sooner was I mounted when the Mule began to play her prankes
and to kick, and to leap out of the way, casting me down and herselfe, both rouling
and tumbling a pace to the rockes and death, had not a shrub prevented me, and a tree
stopped the Mules blind fury. The <i>Indians</i> cried out, <i>milagro, milagro</i>, miracle, miracle,
<i>Santo, Santo</i>, a Saint, a Saint, to me so loud as if they would have had their cry
reach to <i>Rome</i> to helpe forward my canonization; for many such miracles have some
been noised at <i>Rome</i>, and with further contribution of mony have been enrolled in the
booke and Catalogue of Saints. Whilst the <i>Indians</i> helped me up and brought the Mule
againe into the way, they did nothing but flatter me with this terme Saint; which they
needed not have done, if as they considered my dangerous fall and stopping at a shrub
(which was by chance, and not by miracle) they had further considered my passion and
hasty wrath (not befitting a Saint) wherewith I threatned to bast their ribs for deceiving
mee with a yong Mule not well accustomed to the saddle. But all my hasty words and
anger could not discredit me with them, nor lessen their conceipt of my holinesse and
sanctity, who hold the anger and wrath of a Preist to be the breath of Gods nostrils,
and with this their foolish conceipt of mee, they kneeled before me kissing my hands.
The businesse being further examined, they confessed that they had been mistaken in the
Mules, having sadled for me that which should have carried my Petaca's, or leatherne
chests, which was a young Mule accustomed onely to carriages, and not to the saddle,
and upon that which should have been sadled they put my carriage. Whilst they
unloaded and loaded again and sadled the right Mule, I walked up the hill about a mile,
and when they overtooke me I got up and rid till I met with my refreshing harbour and
Chocolatte, and many <i>Indians</i> that came to receive me, among whom it was presently
noised that I was a Saint and had wrought a miracle in the way; with this the rest
of the <i>Indians</i> kneeled to me and kissed my hands, and in the way that we went to the
Towne, all their talk was of my sanctity. I was much vexed at their simplicity, but
the more they saw mee unwilling to accept of that honour, the more they pressed it
upon me. When I came to the Town I told the Frier what had happened, and what
the foolish <i>Indians</i> had conceited; at which he laughed, and told me that he would
warrant me if I staied long in the Towne, all the men and women would come to
kisse my hands and to offer their gifts unto me. He knew well their qualities, or else
had taught them this superstition with many others; for no sooner had we dined, but
many were gathered to the Church to see the Saint that was come to their Towne, and
that had wrought a miracle in the mountaine as he came. With this I began to be more
troubled then before at the folly of the simple people, and desired the Fryer to checke
and rebuke them, who by no means would, but rather laughed at it, saying, that in policy
we ought to accept of any honour from the <i>Indians</i>, for as long as we had credit
and an opinion of Saints among them, so long we should prevaile to do any thing with them,
yea even to command them and their fortunes at our pleasure. With this I went downe
with the Frier to the Church, and sate downe with him in a chaire in the Quire, representing
the person of such a Saint as they imagined me to be, though in reality and
truth but a wretched sinner.</p>

<p>No sooner had we taken up our places, when the <i>Indians</i>, men, women, and children
came up by three and four, or whole families to the Quire, first kneeling down for
my blessing, and then kissing my hands, they began to speake to me in their <i>Indian</i>
complements to this purpose, that their Town was happy and doubtlesse blessed from
heaven by my coming into it, and that they hoped their soules should be much the better
if they might partake of my praiers to God for them. And for this purpose some
offered unto me money, some hony, some egs, some little mantles, some Plantins,
and other fruits, some fowles, and some Turkeys. The Frier that sate by me I perceived
was overjoyed with this, for he knew I was to be gone, and would leave unto
him all those offerings. I desired him to make answer unto the <i>Indians</i> in my behalfe,
excusing me as not well versed in their language (yet the fooles if they thought and
judged me to be a Saint, might have expected from me also the gift of tongues) which
he did telling them that I had been but a while in that Country, and though I understood
part of their language, yet could not speake nor pronounce it perfectly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
therefore from me he did give them hearty thankes for the great love they had shewed
unto an Ambassadour of God, witnessing it with so many sorts of offerings, which
assuredly should remind him and mee of our offerings for them, in our praiers and
hearty recommendations of them and their children unto God. Thus was that ceremony
ended, the <i>Indians</i> dismissed, and the Frier and I went up to a chamber, where he
began to tell his egs and fowles and to dispose of some of them for our supper; he told
me he would take them, but at my departure would give me somewhat for them; he bad
me keep what money they had given me, and told me I was welcome unto him, and no
burdensome guesse, but very profitable, who had brought with me store of provision
for my selfe and for him many daies after. The money I received came to fourty Rials,
besides twenty which he gave me for the other offerings, which might be worth fourty
more; all this I got for having a fall from a Mule, and for not breaking my necke.
I would faine have departed the next morning, but <i>John Vidall</i> (so was the Frier named)
would not permit me, for that the next journey was of at least ten leagues,
and therefore he would have me rest my selfe the next day.</p>

<p>This Towne of <i>Zojabah</i>, or <i>Sacualpa</i> is the biggest and fairest of all the Towns that
belong unto the Priory of <i>Sacapula</i>; the <i>Indians</i> are rich, and make of their Cotton-wool
many mantles, they have plenty of hony, and great flocks of goats and kids;
but here, nor in all the Townes behind there is no wheat, save only <i>Indian</i> Maiz. The
next day some small offerings fell unto mee, but nothing like the day before; and so I
told the Frier, that now the peoples devotion was decaied, I would bee gone in the
morning before day. That night the chiefe <i>Indians</i> of the Towne came to offer their
service and attendance upon me to a Rancho or lodge that standeth in the middle way;
but I would not accept of the great ones, but desired that I might have three onely of
the meaner sort to guide mee till I met with company from the Towne whither I was
going, and whither I had sent warning of my comming. The time appointed was
three of the clock in the morning; at which houre after a little sleep I was called, and
having drunke my Chocolatte, and eat a maple bread with a little conserve, I prepared
my selfe for my journey, and found the <i>Indians</i> ready waiting for me in the yard, with
pieces of pine-wood, which burn like torches, and with which they use to travell in the
night, and to shew the way to him whom they guide. A little from the Towne wee
had some craggy wayes, which indeed had need of lights, but afterwards we came into
a plaine champaigne Countrey, which continued till within a league of the middle
way lodge; to the which we were to descend a steep hill. When we came thither (which
was about seven in the morning) we found our fresh supply waiting for us, who had set
out from their Towne at midnight to meet us (note the <i>Indians</i> subjection to their
Preists command) and had made us a fire, and warmed water for our Chocolatte.
Which whilst I was drinking, the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zojabah</i>, who had guided me thither, gave
notice to those that came to receive from <i>St. Martin</i> (so was the Towne called whither
I was that day minded) of my miracle and sanctity, wishing them to reverence
and respect me in the way. But not for this their foolish report did I make the <i>Indians</i>
of <i>Zojabah</i> drinke every one a cup of Chocolatte, and so dismissed them; and took forwards
my journey to <i>St. Martin</i>. Most of the way was hilly and craggy till we came
within two miles of the Towne; to the which we arrived by noone. This Towne is
cold, standing high, yet pleasant for the prospect almost to <i>Guatemala</i>; here, and in
most of the Towns about it is most excellent wheat. The hony of this Towne is the
best in the Countrey; but above all it furnisheth <i>Guatemala</i> with Quailes, Partridges,
and Rabbits. It is the first Towne wee enter into belonging to the City and command
of <i>Guatemala</i>; which did not a little comfort me, that now I wanted but one good
journey to make an end of my long, tedious and wearisome travelling. The Frier
of this Towne named <i>Thomas de la Cruz</i> belonged unto the Dominican Cloister of
<i>Guatemala</i>; he was a Criolian, but yet he entertained me very lovingly. I staied with
him but that night. And in the morning (though I might have gone to dinner to <i>Guatemala</i>)
I would needs goe by the way to one of the biggest Townes in that Countrey,
called <i>Chimaltenango</i>, standing in an open valley three leagues from the City, consisting
of a thousand house-keepers, and rich <i>Indians</i> who trade much about the Countrey.
In this Towne in my time there was one <i>Indian</i>, who alone had bestowed upon the
Church five thousand duckates. The Church yeelds to none in the City of <i>Guatemala</i>,
and in musick it exceeds most about the Country. The chief feast of <i>Chimaltenango</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
upon the 26. day of <i>July</i>, (which they call St. <i>Annes</i> day) and then is the richest faire
that ever my eyes beheld in those parts of all sorts of Merchants and Merchandize;
It is further set forth with Bull-baiting, Horse-racing, Stage-playes, Maskes, dances,
Musick, and all this gallantly performed by the <i>Indians</i> of the Town. The Fryer of
this Town was a Dominican, belonging to the Cloister of the Dominicans of <i>Guatemala</i>,
named <i>Alonso Hidalgo</i>, a foure eyed old man, for hee alwaies wore spectacles.
Hee was a <i>Spaniard</i> borne, but having beene brought up in that Country from his
youth, and having taken his habit and vowes in <i>Guatemala</i> amongst the Criolians,
hee degenerated from his birth and Country-men, hating all such as came from <i>Spain</i>.
Hee was a deadly enemy to the Provinciall (ayming indeed himselfe to bee Provinciall
with the favour of the Criolians) and so I perceived hee would have picked a quarrell
with mee, whilst I was with him; hee told mee I was welcome, though hee had
little reason to bid any welcome that had come from <i>Spain</i>, who hee thought came
but to supplant those that had been born and brought up there in their own Country,
and that for ought hee knew, I learning the language of those <i>Indians</i> might one
day dispossesse him of that Towne, wherein hee had continued above ten yeers; hee
envied much against the Provinciall and Fryer <i>John Baptist</i> the Prior of <i>Guatemala</i>,
whom hee knew to bee my friend; But to all this I answered not a word, respecting
his grave and old age, and Crystall spectacles. At last he told mee that hee had heard
say, that the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Zojabah</i> had cried mee up for a Saint, which hee could not beleeve
of any that came from <i>Spain</i>, much lesse of mee that came from <i>England</i> a countrey
of hereticks; but hee feared rather that I might come as a spie, to view the riches
of that their Country, and betray them hereafter to <i>England</i>; and that in <i>Guatemala</i>
there were many rich pieces, especially a picture of our Lady, and a lampe in the Cloister
of the Dominicans, which he doubted not but I would bee carefull to pry into. But
all this I put up with a jest, saying, that I would bee sure to take notice first of the
riches of his chamber in pictures, hangings, and rich Cabinets, and that if the <i>English</i>
came thither in my time, I would surely conduct them to it; and if hee himselfe
would but cause a set of teeth of silver to bee set in his gums and jawes in stead of those
leaden ones, (for hee was so old that hee had lost all his teeth, and had got some of lead
in their stead) then surely I would also conduct the <i>English</i> to him as to a rich prize for
his teeth, and that I would warrant him hee should bee well used for his outward and
inward riches; and that this my counsell might bee profitable and of consequence to
him, I told him; for if the <i>English</i> should come, certainly they would try of what
metall his teeth were made, thinking that they might bee of some rare and exquisite
substance found onely in that Country, and so might cause him to drink such hot and
scalding broth, (to try whether they were lead) as might melt them in his mouth, and
make the melted lead runne downe his throat, which if they were of silver, they would
not doe. Hee perceived I jeared him, and so hee let mee alone; I was glad I had put
him out of his former byas of rayling; so dinner being ended, I told him I would not
stay supper, but goe to <i>Guatemala</i> to a light supper in the Cloister, for that hee had
given mee such a dinner, as I feared I should not have digested it in few daies. I desired
him to let me have <i>Indians</i> to guide me to <i>Guatemala</i>, which he willingly performed,
peradventure fearing that if I stayed supper with him, I should melt the teeth in his
mouth with some scalding cup of my Chocolatte brought from <i>Chiapa</i>, or that in
the night I should rifle or plunder his chamber of his rich Idols and Ebony Cabinets.
The <i>Indians</i> being come, I made hast to be gone from that four eyed beast, being now desirous
of a constant rest in <i>Guatemala</i>. Within a league from this Town of <i>Chimaltenango</i>,
the Rode way leaving that open, wide, and spatious valley, contracts and gathereth in
it selfe between hils and mountaines standing on each side, and so continueth to the
City. From this Valley unto <i>Guatemala</i>, neither is there any ascent or descent but a
plaine, broad and sandy way. The eye hath much to view, though compassed with
Mountaines, in these two last leagues; for yet it may behold a Town of <i>Indians</i> which
taketh up most of the way, and is counted as big as <i>Chimaltenango</i>, if not bigger, the
houses lying scattered with a distance one from another, mingled with many fair buildings
of <i>Spaniards</i>, who resort much thither from the City for their recreation. This
Town is called <i>Xocotenango</i>, of a fruit named Xocotte, which is most plentifull there,
and all about the Country; it is fresh and cooling, of a yellow colour when ripe, and
of two sorts, some sweet, and others sowre, of the stones whereof the <i>Indians</i> make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
fire; they lie so thick in the way, dropping from the trees for want of gathering and
spending them all, that the <i>Spaniards</i> have begun to practise the buying of Hogs on purpose
to let them runne about that high way, finding that they fat as speedily and as
well with those plummes, as our Hogs doe in <i>England</i> with Akorns. All this way are
also many faire gardens, which supply the Markets of <i>Guatemala</i> with herbs, roots,
fruits, and flowers all the yeer. There are further in this Rode three water mills for
the corn of the City, whereof the chief and the richest belongs to the Dominican Fryers
of <i>Guatemala</i>, who keep there a Fryer constantly with three or foure Blackmores to doe
and oversee the worke; What will not those Fryers doe to satisfie their covetous
mindes? Even dusty Millars they will become to get wealth. The Frontispice of the
Church of this Town is judged one of the best pieces of worke thereabouts; the high
Altar within is also rich and stately, being all daubed with gold. I made no stay in
this place, because I knew I should have many occasions after my setling in the City to
come unto it. And thus keeping between the hils I continued on my journey till I came
to <i>Guatemala</i>, whose Dominions, riches and greatnesse the following chapter shall
largely shew.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="CHAP_XVIII" id="CHAP_XVIII">CHAP. XVIII.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Describing the Dominions, Government, Riches, and greatnesse of the City of</i>
Guatemala, <i>and Country belonging unto it.</i></h4>


<p>I had not rid on above a mile from the Church of <i>Xocotenango</i>, when the hils
and Mountaines seemed to depart one from another, leaving a more spatious
object for the eye to behold, and a wider Valley to wander in. The fame
of that City from <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Chiapa</i> had raised up my thoughts to conceit
of some strong walls, Towers, Forts or Bulwarks to keep out an aspiring
or attempting enemy; But when I came neere and least thought of it, I found my self
in it without entring through walls, or gates, or passing over any bridge, or finding any
watch or guard to examine who I was; but passing by a new built Church, standing
neere a place of dunghils, where were none but mean houses, some thatched, and some
tyled, and asking what Town that was, answer was made me that it was the City of <i>Guatemala</i>,
and that that, being called St. <i>Sebastian</i>, was the onely Parish Church of the City.
With this my high conceiting thoughts stooped down to think of some second <i>Chiapa</i>;
till having continued on a while by houses on my right hand and dunghils on my left,
I came to a broader street having houses on each side, which seemed to promise a City at
hand. At my first turning I discovered a proud and stately Cloister, which was the
place of rest to my wearied body. I surrounded it to finde out the back gate, and
there lighted, and enquired for the Prior, who bad me very welcome, assuring me that
for the Provincials sake, I should want no incouragement, and that hee would doe for
mee much more then what the Provinciall had signified unto him by Letters. He told
mee hee had beene brought up in <i>Spain</i>, in the Country of <i>Asturias</i>, where many <i>English</i>
ships did use to come, and having seen there many of my Nation, he affected them
very much, and to mee as one of so good a Nation, and as a stranger and Pilgrime out of
my owne Country, hee would shew all the favour that the utmost of his power would
afford. How glad was I, to find in him so contrary an opinion to that of foure eyed <i>Hidalgo</i>?
And how did he performe his words? He was the chief Master and Reader of
Divinity in the University, his name Master <i>Jacintho de Cabannas</i>, who finding mee desirous
to follow the Schools, and especially to hear from him some lessons of Theologie,
within the first quarter of yeer, that I had been his constant and attentive Auditor, graced
mee with a publick act of conclusions of Divinity, which I was to defend under his
direction and moderation in the face of the whole University and Assembly of Doctors
and Divines, against the Tenents of <i>Scotus</i> and <i>Suarez</i>. But the principall and head
conclusion was concerning the birth of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, whom both Jesuites, <i>Suarez</i>
and Franciscans, and Scotists hold to have beene borne without Originall sinne, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
any guilt or staine of it, against whose fond, foolish and ungrounded fancies, I publickly
defended with <i>Thomas Aquinas</i>, and all Thomists, that shee (as well as all <i>Adams</i> posterity)
was borne in Originall sin. It was an act, the like whereof had not been so controverted
in that University with arguments in <i>contra</i>, and their answers and solutions,
and with reasons and arguments in <i>pro</i> many yeers before. The Jesuites stamped with
their feet, clapt with their hands, railed with their tongues, and condemned it with
their mouths for a heresie, saying, that in <i>England</i>, where were hereticks, such an
opinion concerning Christs mother might bee held, and defended by mee who had
my birth among hereticks, but that Master <i>Cabannas</i> borne among <i>Spaniards</i>, and
brought up in their Universities, and being the chief Reader in that famous Academy
should maintaine such an opinion, they could not but much marvaile and wonder at it.
But with patience I told them, that strong reasons, and the further authority of many
learned <i>Thomist</i> Divines should satisfie their vaine and clamorous wondring. The
Act was ended, and though with Jesuites I could get no credit, yet with the Dominicans,
and with Master <i>Cabannas</i>, I got so much that I never after lost it for the space
of almost twelve yeers; but was still honored by the meanes of this <i>Cabannas</i> and
Fryer <i>John Baptist</i> the Prior of <i>Chiapa</i> (who at Christmas ensuing was made Prior
of <i>Guatemala</i>) with honors and preferments as great as ever stranger was living among
<i>Spaniards</i>. These two above named being at Candlemas or beginning of <i>February</i>
that same yeer at <i>Chiapa</i>, at the election of a new Provinciall, would not forget mee
their poorest friend stil abiding in <i>Guatemala</i>, but remembring that the University (which
belonged chiefly to the Cloister) at Michaelmas would want a new Reader or Master
of Arts to begin with Logick, continue through the eight bookes of Physicks, and
to end with the Metaphysicks, propounded mee to the new elected Provinciall (whose
name was Fryer <i>John Ximeno</i>) and to the whole Chapter and Conventicle of the Province
for Reader of Arts in <i>Guatemala</i> the Michaelmas next ensuing. Their suit for me
was so earnest and their authority so great that nothing could bee denied them, and
so they brought unto mee from the Provinciall Chapter these insuing Letters Patents,
from Fryer <i>John Ximeno</i>, whose form and manner I thought fit here to insert out of the
Original in <i>Spanish</i> (which to this day abideth with me) for curiosity and satisfaction of
my Reader.</p>

Whereas our Convent of Saint <i>Dominick</i> of <i>Guatemala</i> wanteth and stands
in need of a Reader of Arts: By these presents I doe institute, name and
appoint for Reader Fryer <i>Thomas</i> of Saint <i>Mary</i>, for the great satisfaction
which I have of his sufficiency. And I command the Prior of the foresaid
our Convent, that hee put him into full possession and enjoyment of the said
Office. And for the greater merit of obedience I command him (our forenamed
Reader,) by vertue of the Holy Ghost, and of holy obedience, and under
a formall precept, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, Amen. Dated in this our Convent of <i>Chiapa</i> the Royall, the ninth

<p>This honour conferred upon mee a stranger, and new commer to the Province,
made the Criolian party and some others (who had aymed at that place and preferment
in the University) to stomack mee. But to mee it was a spurre to stir and prick
mee on to a more eager pursuit of learning, to frequent the <i>Academy</i> lessons with more
care and diligence; and to spend my selfe and time, day and night, more in studying,
that so I might performe with like honour that which was laid upon mee, and answer
the expectation of my best and forwardest friends. Three yeers I continued in this
Convent and City in obedience to the forecited Patents; oftentimes I thought within
my self that the honour of my <i>English</i> Nation here lay upon me in <i>Guatemala</i>, in not
suffering any <i>Spaniard</i> to goe beyond mee, or to outbrave mee with gallant, witty and
well seeming arguments; and so many times I would at nine of the clock at night,
when others were gone to bed, take in my chamber a cup of hot Chocolatte, that with
it I might banish sleep from mine eyes, and might the better continue in my study till
one or two in the morning, being bound to awake and bee up again by six. I was loath
in these three yeers to take upon mee any other of such charges which are common in
such Convents; but especially to preach much, and to hear the Confessions of such
both men and women as resorted to the Church of that Cloister, lest hereby my studies
might bee hindered, and time spent in other waies. Yet the Prior and Master <i>Cabannas</i>
would often bee very importunate with mee, to obtaine the Bishops License for
hearing of Confessions, and Preaching abroad in the City and Country (for in the
Church of that Cloister I might and did sometimes, though seldome preach with Permission
of the Provinciall) but this I strongly refused, untill such time as the Provinciall
himselfe came to <i>Guatemala</i>, who hearing me once Preach, would by all meanes have
mee further licensed and authorised from the Bishop, that so I might not bee straitned
within the Cloisters limits, but abroad in other Churches might freely Preach, and
thereby get some money for the better furnishing my selfe with Bookes. Hee therefore
commanded mee to bee examined by five examiners all able Divines, for the space of
three houres (as is the custome of that Order) and having three houres stood under their
hard and rigid questions and examination, having also at the end obtained their approbation,
then the Provinciall presented mee unto the Bishop with these words following,
being taken out of the Originall yet abiding with mee.</p>

<p>This forme of licence to preach and heare confessions, from the Bishop of <i>Guatemala</i>,
is worth Englishing for some things in it, which I shall observe with inclosed

<p>Wee (<i>Bishops in that Church scorne the name of a singular person,
shewing they have the power of all persons joyned together in them,
of rich and poore, of subject and Prince</i>) Master and Lord Frier <i>John de Sandoval
y Capata</i> of the Order of St. <i>Augustin</i> (<i>though brought up in a poore
Mendicant Cloister, yet now he takes upon him the Title of a Lord, and shewes
how Prelates in that Church use to Lord it over the people</i>) by the Divine Grace
Bishop of <i>Guatemala</i> and the <i>Vera Paz</i>, (<i>he stiles himselfe a Bishop by Divine
Grace, whereas he himselfe acording to the common report of him, as also are
most Bishops there made, was made Bishop not by any Divine Grace, but by unwarranted
Simony and favour from Courtiers, having given many thousand
Crownes for that his Bishopricke</i>) of his Majesties Councell (<i>Bishops there
must be Counsellors to Kings, and meddle in Court and Politicke affaires</i>) by
these Present give licence to Father Frier <i>Thomas</i> of Saint <i>Mary</i>, of the Order
of Preachers, contained in the Presentation from his religious Order on
the back-side of this our licence, that throughout all our Bishopricke he may
and doe preach the word of God (<i>yet I confesse This word of God is little used
in Sermons in that Church, but rather the words of Saints of theirs and Fathers,
and lying words of miracles, wherewith they stuffe up a whole houres preaching</i>)
and that he may and doe administer the holy Sacrament of Penance (<i>not holy
as it came from the mouth of him to whom the Seraphims cry Holy, Holy, Holy,
but as it came from the head of</i> Rome, <i>who sacrilegiously stiles himselfe Holinesse
and most Holy Father. Not a Sacrament as so left and ordained by Christ,
but one of</i> Romes <i>seven Sacraments, which as it is a City knowne and distinguished
by seven hills, so will that Church be knowne and distinguished from the
true Church by seven Sacraments</i>) generally to all persons, which shall have
devotion to confesse with him, excepting Nuns (<i>this Bishop had in that City
one of the six Judges of the Chancery his daughter a Nun called</i> Donna Juana
de Maldonado y Paz, <i>whom he loved dearly, and much conferred with her in
private in the Cloister, whose private conferences he was jealous they should
be knowne in Confession, and therefore would suffer none to hear Nuns Confessions,
but such as were his most intimate friends, and of whom he had great
satisfaction, alleadging this reason that such as heard Nuns Confessions ought
to be very skilfull and experienced in such waies, and men of age; for that greater
cases of Conscience were to be met with in Nuns Confessions, than in others.
By which reason he unwisely brought an aspersion upon those Virgins, who should
live chastly and holily as separated from the world and inclosed, and yet it seems
by this Bishops opinion, that within their inclosed walls sins are committed more
grievous then abroad in the wide world, and such as may puzzle a Ghostly Father
if not skillfull and ancient</i>) and that he may and doe absolve all persons
which shall confesse with him (<i>if onely God can pardon and absolve from sinne,
Oh how is Gods power arrogated and taken, yea and abused by those sacrilegious
Priests!</i>) from all their sins, crimes, and excesses, excepting such cases as are
reserved to his Holinesse, and to us by Canon right. (<i>A wicked rule and Canon,
a Government certainly most cruell and tyrannicall, that bindes poor wretches
in some cases to goe from</i> America <i>to</i> Rome<i>, at least eight thousand miles to
cleare their Consciences before the Pope, or else they must die without pardon
and absolution from sinne, many having not meanes to goe thither, nor gifts to
bestow upon their Pope, who must be bribed to absolve them. O how more sweet,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<i>comfortable and safe is it for a heinous sinner and offendour even at home or in
the Church grieving within his heart, and keeping within himselfe, to lift up
a broken heart, and make that poste and flie with wings of Eagles to the high
Throne of Gods grace and mercy, with assured confidence that there only is pardon,
remission and absolution granted to all such as doe truely and unfeignedly
repent of their sins, crimes and excesses!</i>) Dated in the City of <i>St. James
of Guatemala</i>, the fourth day of <i>December</i>, in the yeer of our Lord 1629.</p>

<p><i>By the Command of my most
Illustrious Lord</i>, Peter Ramirez

<p>Thus with full and ample Commission from the Bishop and the Provinciall was I setled
in <i>Guatemala</i>, to read and preach, where, (although I might have continued many
yeers and was offered to read Divinity, having in part begun it one quarter of a yeere)
I continued yet but three yeers and almost an halfe for the reason I shall shew hereafter.
So what in that time I could observe of that City, and of the Countrey round about,
having had occasions to travaile about it both when I lived in <i>Guatemala</i>, and
afterwards when I lived for above seven yeers in the Countrey Townes, I shall truly
and faithfully recommend unto my Reader. This City of <i>Guatemala</i> (called by the
Spaniards <i>Santiago</i>, or <i>St. James</i> of <i>Guatemala</i>) is seated in a valley, which is not above
two miles and a halfe broad, for the high mountaines doe keep it close in; but in length
towards the South-sea it continues a wide and champaigne Countrey, opening it selfe
broader a little beyond that Towne, which to this day is called <i>la Ciudad Vieja</i>, or the
old City, standing somewhat above three miles from <i>Guatemala</i>. Though the mountaines
on each side doe strongly environ it, and especially on the East-side seem to hang
over it, yet none of them are hinderers to Travellers, who over them have opened
waies easie for man and beasts though heavily laden with wares of all sorts. The way
from <i>Mexico</i>, if taken by the coast of <i>Soconuzco</i>, and <i>Suchutepeques</i> comes into the
City North-west-ward, which is a wide, open and sandy rode; if it be taken by
<i>Chiapa</i>, it lieth North-east, and entreth into the City between the mountaines, as
before hath been noted. West-ward to the South-sea the way lieth open through the
valley and a champaigne Countrey. But South or South-East, the entrance is over
high and steepy hils, which is the common Rode from <i>Comayagua, Nicaragua</i>, and the
<i>Golfo dulce</i> or sweet Gulfe, where the ships come yeerly and unlade all the Commodities
which are brought from <i>Spaine</i> for <i>Guatemala</i>. This also is the way followed by them
who take a journey meer East-ward from this City. But the chiefest mountaines, which
straighten in this City and valley are two, called Vulcanes, the one being a Vulcan of
water, and the other a Vulcan or mountain of fire, termed so by the <i>Spaniards</i>, though
very improperly a Vulcan may be said to containe water, it taking its name from the
heathenish God <i>Vulcan</i>, whose profession and imployment chiefly was in fire. These
two famous mountaines stand almost the one over against the other, on each side of the
valley; that of water hanging on the South-side almost perpendicularly over the City,
the other of fire standing lower from it, more opposite to the old City. That of water
is higher then the other, and yeelds a goodly prospect to the sight, being almost all the
yeer green, and full of <i>Indian</i> Milpa's, which are plantations of <i>Indian</i> wheat; and in
the small and petty Townes which lie some halfe way up it, some at the foot of it, there
are Roses, Lillies, and other flowers all the yeer long in the gardens, besides Plantins,
Apricockes, and many sorts of sweet and delicate fruits. It is called by the <i>Spaniards,
el Vulcan del agua</i>, or the Vulcan of water, because on the other side of it from
<i>Guatemala</i> it springs with many brookes towards a Towne called Saint <i>Christopher</i>, and
especially is thought to preserve and nourish on that side also a great lake of fresh water,
by the Townes called <i>Amatitlan</i> and <i>Petapa</i>. But on the side of it towards <i>Guatemala</i>
and the valley it yeelds also so many springs of sweet and fresh water, as have caused and
made a river which runneth along the valley close by the City, and is that which drives
the water-mills spoken of before in <i>Xocotenango</i>. This river was not known when first
the <i>Spaniards</i> conquered that Country; but since, according to their constant Tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the City of <i>Guatemala</i> standing higher and neerer to the <i>Vulcan</i> in that place and
Town which to this day is called <i>la Ciudad Vieja</i>, or the old City, there lived in it then
about the yeer 1534. a Gentlewoman called <i>Donna Maria de Castilia</i>, who having lost
her husband in the warres, and that same yeer buried also all her children, grew so impatient
under these her crosses and afflictions, that impiously she defied God, saying,
What can God do more unto me now then he hath done? he hath done his worst without
it be to take away my life also, which I now regard not. Upon these words there
gushed out of this Vulcan such a flood of water as carried away this woman with the
streame, ruined many of the houses, and caused the inhabitants to remove to the place
where now standeth <i>Guatemala</i>. This is the <i>Spaniards</i> own Tradition, which if true,
should be our example to learne to feare and not to defie God, when his judgements
shew him to us angry and a God that will overcome, when he judgeth. From that time,
and from this their Tradition is the Towne now standing where first stood <i>Guatemala</i>,
called <i>la Ciudad Vieja</i>, or the old City, and hath continued a river which before was
not knowne, having its head and spring from this high Vulcan, whose pleasant springs,
gardens, fruits, flowers and every green and flourishing prospect might be a fair object
to a <i>Martials</i> wit, who here would fancie a new <i>Parnassus</i>, find out new steps of flying
<i>Pegasus</i>, and greet the Nymphes and nine Sisters with this their never yet discovered
and <i>American</i> habitation. This Vulcan or mountaine is not so pleasing to the sight
(whose height is judged full nine miles unto the top) but the other which standeth on
the other side of the valley opposite unto it, is unpleasing and more dreadfull to behold,
for here are ashes for beauty, stones and flints for fruits and flowers, baldnesse for greennesse,
barrennesse for fruitfulnesse, for water whisperings and fountaine murmurs, noise
of thunders and roaring of consuming metals, for running streams, flashings of fire, for
tall and mighty trees and Cedars, Castles of smoak rising in height to out-dare the skie
and firmament, for sweet and odoriferous and fragrant smels, a stink of fire and brimstone,
which are stil in action striving within the bowels of that ever burning and fiery
Vulcan. Thus is <i>Guatemala</i> seated in the midst of a Paradise on the one side and a hell on
the other, yet never hath this hell broke so loose as to consume that flourishing City.
True it is formerly many yeers agoe it opened a wide mouth on the top, and breathed
out such fiery ashes as filled the houses of <i>Guatemala</i> and the Country about, and parched
all the plants and fruits, and spued out such stones and rockes which had they
fallen upon the City would have crushed it to pieces, but they fell not farre from it, but
to this day lie about the bottome and sides of it, causing wonder to those that behold
them, and taking away admiration from them that admire the force and strength of fire
and powder in carrying on a weighty bullet from the mouth of a cannon, whereas here
the fire of this mountaine hath cast up into the aire and tumbled downe to the bottom
of it such rockes as in bignesse exceed a reasonable house, and which not the strength of
any twenty Mules (as hath been tried) have been able to remove. The fire which flasheth
out of the top of this mountain is sometimes more and sometimes lesse; yet while
I lived in the City, on a certaine time for the space of three or foure dayes and nights
it did so burne that my friend Mr. <i>Cabannas</i> confidently avouched to mee and others,
that standing one night in his window he had with the light of that fire read a letter,
the distance being above three <i>English</i> miles. The roaring also of this monstrous
beast is not constantly alike, but is greater in the summer time then in the winter, that
is, from <i>October</i> to the end of <i>April</i>, then all the rest of the yeer; for then it seems, the
winds entring into those concavities set the fire on work harder then at other times, and
cause the mountaine to roare and the earth about to quake. There was a time three yeers
before my comming to that City, when the inhabitants expected nothing but utter
ruine and destruction, and durst not abide within their houses for nine dayes (the earthquakes
continuing and increasing more and more) but made bowers and arbours in the
Market place, placing there their Idoll Saints and Images, especially St. <i>Sebastian</i>, whom
they hoped would deliver them from that judgement, and for this purpose they dayly
carried him through the streets in solemn and idolatrous procession and adoration. But
all the while I lived there the noise within the mountaine, the smoake and flashes of fire
without, and the Summer earth-quakes were such that with the use and custome of
them I never feared any thing, but thought that City the healthiest and pleasantest place
of dwelling that ever I came into in all my travels. The climate is very temperate, farre
exceeding either <i>Mexico</i> or <i>Guaxaca</i>. Neither are the two fore-named Cities better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
stored with fruits, herbes for salets, provision of fish, and flesh, Beef, Mutton, Veale, Kid,
Fowles, Turkies, Rabbets, Quailes, Partridges, Pheasants, and of <i>Indian</i> and <i>Spanish</i>
Wheat, then is this City: from the South Sea (which lyeth in some places not above
twelve leagues from it) and from the Rivers of the South Sea Coast, and from the
fresh Lake of <i>Amatitlan</i> and <i>Petapa</i>, and from another Lake lying three or foure leagues
from <i>Chimalienango</i>; it is well and plentifully provided for of fish. But for Beef there is
such plenty, that it exceeds all parts of <i>America</i>, without exception, as may be known
by the Hydes, which are sent yeerly to <i>Spain</i> from the country of <i>Guatemala</i>, where
they commonly kill their Cattell, more for the game of their Hydes in <i>Spain</i>, then
for the goodnesse or fatnesse of the flesh, which though it bee not to bee compared
to our <i>English</i> Beef, yet it is good mans meat, and so cheap, that in my time it was
commonly sold at thirteene pound and a halfe for half a Riall, the least coyne there,
and as much as three pence here. Though all about this Country there are very great
and spatious Estancia's, or Farmes for breeding onely, even neer to the <i>Golfo Dulce</i>,
where the ships ride that come from <i>Spain</i>, yet from <i>Comayagua</i>, St. <i>Salvador</i> and <i>Nicaragua</i>,
is <i>Guatemala</i> stored; But above all are the great Estancia's in the South Sea
Coast or Marsh, where in my time there was a Grazier that reckoned up going in his
owne Estancia and ground, forty thousand heads of Beasts, small and great, besides
many which are called there Simarrones, or wild Cattell, which were strayed among
the Woods and Mountaines, and could not bee gathered in with the rest, but were
hunted by the Blackmores like wild Bores, and daily shot to death, least they should
too much increase and doe hurt. My selfe chanced to bee present at the Fair of the
Town of <i>Petapa</i>, with a friend named <i>Lope de Chaves</i>, (who was as they call there,
Obligado, or charged to provide flesh for six or seven Townes thereabouts) who at
one bargain, and of one man, bought six thousand head of Cattell, great and small,
paying one with another eighteen Rials, or nine English shillings a head.</p>

<p>The manner and custome of <i>Guatemala</i> for the better providing both Beef and Mutton
for it, and the Country Townes about, is this. Nine daies before Michaelmas, every
day Proclamation is made about the City for an Obligado, or one that will bee
bound to the City and Country for competent provision of Flesh meat upon forfeiture
of such a summe of money to his Majesty, if hee faile, as shall bee agreed upon
between him and the Court, and to the Inhabitants of the City; if hee fail in beef,
hee is to allow in Mutton so many pounds at the same rate as hee should have allowed
beef. If the Obligado faile in Mutton, hee is to allow in Fowle flesh, so many
pounds and at the same rate as hee was to allow the Mutton; and this with consideration
of the family, what competent allowance of flesh meat shall bee judged for a
day, or the dayes that the Obligado shall fail. Besides this the Proclamation is made
for whom offers most to his Majesty for one yeers Obligation. So that sometimes it happeneth
that the eight daies severall men come into the Court, offering more and more,
till upon the ninth day and last Proclamation, the Office is setled for one yeere upon
him that hath offered most unto his Majesty. Thus many Butchers are not allowed
but one onely Obligado, who also is abridged to so many pound for so much mony, so
that if any other besides him offer to kill or sell, he may follow an action and the Court
against him: Thus the Obligado (who commonly is a monied man) buyeth by the
hundred or by the thousand, as for the present hee findeth the expence of the City,
without hee bee himself such a Grazier, as hath Cattell enough of his owne. Though
Mutton bee not so plentifull as is Beef, yet there never wants from the Valley of <i>Mixco,
Pinola, Petapa</i>, and <i>Amatitlan</i>, and the <i>Marsh</i> and other places. In the Valley fore-named
I lived, and was well acquainted with one <i>Alonso Capata</i>, who had constantly
going in the Valley four thousand sheep. <i>Guatemala</i> therefore is so well stored with
good provision, plentifull and cheap, that it is hard to finde in it a begger, for with
halfe a Riall the poorest may buy beef for a weeke, and with a few Cacao's they may
have bread of <i>Indian</i> Maiz, if not of <i>Spanish</i> Wheat. This City may consist of about
five thousand families, besides a Suburb of <i>Indians</i> called <i>el Barrio de Sto. Domingo</i>,
where may bee two hundred families more. The best part of the City is that which
joyneth to this Suburb of <i>Indians</i>, and is called also <i>el Barrio Santo de Domingo</i>, by reason
of the Cloister of Saint <i>Dominick</i> which standeth in it. Here are the richest and
best shops of the City, with the best buildings, most of the houses being new, and
stately. Here is also a dayly Tianguez (as they call it) or petty Market, where some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<i>Indians</i> all the day sit selling fruits, Herbs, and Cacao, but at the foure in the afternoone,
this Market is filled for a matter of an houre, where the <i>Indian</i> women meet to
sell their Country slap, (which is dainties to the Criolians) as Atolle, Pinole, scalded
Plantins, butter of the Cacao, puddings made of <i>Indian</i> Maiz, with a bit of Fowle
or fresh Porke in them seasoned with much red biting Chile, which they call Anacatamales.
The trading of the City is great, for by Mules it partakes of the best commodities of
<i>Mexico, Guaxaca</i> and <i>Chiapa</i>, and Southward of <i>Nicaragua</i>, and <i>Costarica</i>. By
Sea it hath commerce with <i>Peru</i>, by two Sea Ports and Havens, the one called <i>la Villa
de la Trinidad</i>, the Village of the Trinity, which lyeth Southward from it five and
twenty leagues; and by another called <i>el Realejo</i>, which lyeth five or six and forty leagues
from it. It hath traffique with <i>Spain</i> by the North Sea from <i>Golfo dulce</i>, lying threescore
leagues from it. It is not so rich as other Cities, yet for the quantity of it, it
yeelds to none. There were in my time five (besides many other Merchants who were
judged worth twenty thousand Duckats, thirty thousand, fifty thousand, some few
a hundred thousand) who were judged of equall wealth, and generally reported to
bee worth each of them five hundred thousand Duckats; the first was <i>Thomas de Siliezer</i>,
a Biscain born, and <i>Alcalde de Corte</i>, the Kings High Justice, or chief Officer at
Court; the second was <i>Antonio Justiniano</i>, a <i>Genovois</i> born, and one that bore often
Offices in the City, and had many Tenements and houses, especially a great and rich
Farme for corn and Wheat in the Valley of <i>Mexico</i>. The third was <i>Pedro de Lira</i>, born
in <i>Castilia</i>, the fourth and fifth, <i>Antonio Fernandez</i>, and <i>Bartolome Nunnez</i>, both <i>Portingals</i>,
whereof the first in my time departed from <i>Guatemala</i> for some reasons which
here I must conceale. The other foure I left there, the three of them living at that
end of the City called <i>Barrio de Santo Domingo</i>, or the street of St. <i>Dominick</i>, whose
houses and presence makes that street excell all the rest of the City, and their wealth
and trading were enough to denominate <i>Guatemala</i> a very rich City. The Government
of all the Country about, and of all <i>Honduras, Soconusco, Comayagua, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Vera Paz, Suchutepeques</i>, and <i>Chiapa</i>, is subordinate unto the Chancery
of <i>Guatemala</i>; for although every Governour over these severall Provinces is appointed
by the King and Councell of <i>Spain</i>, yet when they come to those
parts to the enjoyment of their charge and execution office, then their actions, if
unjust, are weighed, judged, censured, and condemned by the Court residing in
the City. This Court of Chancery consisteth of a President, six Judges, one Kings
Attourney, and two chief Justices of Court. The President, though hee have not
the name and title of Viceroy, as they of <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Peru</i>, yet his power is as great
and absolute as theirs. His Pension from the King is but twelve thousands Duckats
a yeer; but besides this, if he be covetous, hee makes by bribes and trading twice as
much more, nay what hee list, as was seen in the <i>Count de la Gomera</i>, President of that
City and Chancery for the space of fourteen yeers, who departed in old age from
<i>Guatemala</i> to <i>Canaria</i> (where was his house and place of birth) worth Millions of
Duckats. After him succeeded <i>Don Juan de Guzman</i>, formerly President of <i>Santo
Domingo</i>, who losing his Wife and Lady in the way, lost also his former spirit and courage,
betaking himselfe wholly to his devotions, contemning wealth and riches, governing
with love and mildnesse, which made the rest of the Judges, who were all for
lucre, soone weary him out of his office, continuing in it but five yeers. His successor
(whom I left there when I came away) was <i>Don Gonzalo de Paz y Lorencana</i>, who
was promoted from the Presidency of <i>Panama</i> to that place, and came into it with
such a spirit of covetousnesse as the like had not been seen in any former President.
Hee forbad all gaming in private houses in the City, which there is much used (though
by women not so much as in <i>Mexico</i>) not for that hee hated it, but because hee envied
others, what they got and gained by their Cards, drawing to himselfe thereby
all that gaine, spending sometimes in one night foure and twenty paire of Cards, appointing
a Page to assist at the Tables, and to see the box well paid for every paire of
Cards, which for his, and his Court respect, was seldome lesse then a crown or two
for every paire. Thus did hee lick up with his Cards most of the gamesters gaines, and
would grudge and pick quarrels with such rich men whom hee knew to affect gaming,
if they frequented not his Court at night time for that bewitching Recreation.</p>

<p>The Pension which the King alloweth to every Judge of Chancery is foure thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
duckats yeerly, and three thousand to his Attorney, all which is paid out of the Kings
Exchequer abiding in that City. Yet what besides they get by bribes, and trading is
so much, that I have heard a Judge himselfe <i>Don Luis de las Infantas</i> say, that though
a Judges place at <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Lima</i> be more honourable, yet none more profitable then
<i>Guatemala</i>. In my time were such causes at Chancery tried, as had never been, of murthers,
robberies, and oppressions, and whereas it was expected the offendants some
should be hanged, some banished, some imprisoned, some by fines impoverished, bribes
took all off, so that I never knew one hanged in that City for the space of above eight
yeers. The Churches though they be not so fair and rich as those of <i>Mexico</i>, yet they are
for that place wealthy enough. There is but one Parish Church and a Cathedrall which
standeth in the chiefe Market-place. All the other Churches belong to Cloisters, which
are of Dominicans, Franciscans, Mercenarians, Augustines, and Jesuites, and two
of Nuns, called the Conception and <i>St. Catharine</i>. The Dominicans, Franciscans, and
Mercenarians are stately Cloisters, containing neer a hundred Friers a piece; but above
all is the Cloister where I lived, of the Dominicans, to which is joyned in a great Walk
before the Church the Universitie of the City. The yeerly revenues which come into this
Cloister, what from the <i>Indian</i> Towns belonging to it, what from a water-mill, what
from a farme for corne, what from an Estancia, or farme for Horses and Mules, what
from an Ingenio, or farme of Sugar, what from a Mine of silver given unto it the yeer
1633. are judged to be (excepting all charges) at least thirty thousand duckats;
wherewith those fat Friers feast themselves, and have to spare to build, and enrich
their Church and Altars. Besides much treasure belonging to it, there are two things
in it, which the <i>Spaniards</i> in merriment would often tell me that the <i>English</i> nation
did much inquire after, when they tooke any ship of theirs at sea, and that they feared
I was come to spie them, which were a Lampe of silver hanging before the high Altar,
so big as required the strength of three men to hale it up with a rope; but the other
is of more value; which is a picture of the Virgin <i>Mary</i> of pure silver, and of
the stature of a reasonable tall woman, which standeth in a Tabernacle made on purpose
in a Chappel of the Rosary with at least a dozen lampes of silver also burning before
it. A hundred thousand duckats might soone be made up of the treasure belonging
to that Church and cloister. Within the walls of the Cloister there is nothing
wanting which may further pleasure and recreation. In the lower Cloister there is a
spatious garden, in the midst whereof is a fountains casting up the water, and spouting it
out of at least a dozen pipes, which fill two ponds full of fishes, and with this
their constant running give musicke to the whole Cloister, and encouragement to many
water-fowles and Ducks to bath and wash themselves therein. Yet further within
the Cloister, there are other two gardens for fruits and herbage, and in the one a pond
of a quarter of a mile long, all paved at the bottom, and a low stone wall about, where
is a boat for the Friers recreation, who often goe thither to fish, and doe sometimes
upon a suddaine want or occasion take out from thence as much fish as will give to the
whole Cloister a dinner. The other Cloisters of the City are also rich; but next to
the Dominicans is the Cloister of Nuns, called the Conception, in which at my time
there were judged to live a thousand women, not all Nuns, but Nuns, and their serving
maids or slaves, and yong children which were brought up and taught to worke
by the Nuns. The Nuns that are professed bring with them their portions, five hundred
duckats the least, some six hundred, some seven, and some a thousand, which portions
after a few yeers (and continuing to the Cloister after the Nuns decease) come to make
up a great yeerly rent. They that will have maids within to wait on them may, bringing
the bigger portion, or allowing yeerly for their servants diet. In this Cloister lived
that <i>Donna Juana de Maldonado</i> Judge <i>Juan Maldonado de Paz</i> his daughter, whom
the Bishop so much conversed withall. She was very fair and beautifull, and not much
above twenty yeers of age, and yet his love blinding him, he strove what he could
in my time against all the ancient Nuns and Sisters, to make her Superiour and Abbesse,
and caused such a mutiny and strife in that Cloister, which was very scandalous to the
whole City, and made many rich Merchants and Gentlemen run to the Cloister with
their swords drawne, threatning to breake in amongst the Nuns to defend their daughters
against the powerfull faction which the Bishop had wrought for <i>Donna Juana de
Maldonado</i>: which they had performed if the President <i>Don Juan de Guzman</i> had
not sent <i>Juan Maldonado de Paz</i>, the yong Nuns father, to intreat her to desist in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of her yong age from her ambitious thoughts or being Abbesse. With this the mutiny
both within and without ceased, the Bishop got but shame, and his yong Sister continued
as before under command and obedience, to a more religious, grave, and aged Nun
then her selfe. This <i>Donna Juana de Maldonado y Paz</i> was the wonder of all that
Cloister, yea of all the City for her excellent voice, and skill in musicke, and in carriage,
and education yeelded to none abroad nor within; she was witty, well spoken
and above all a <i>Calliope</i>, or Muse for ingenious and suddain verses; which the Bishop
said, so much moved him to delight in her company and conversation. Her father
thought nothing too good, nor too much for her; and therefore having no other
children, he daily conferred upon her riches, as might best beseem a Nun, as rich and
costly Cabinets faced with gold and silver, pictures and Idols for her chamber with
crownes and jewels to adorne them; which with other presente from the Bishop (who
dying in my time left not wherewith to pay his debts, for that as the report went, he
had spent himselfe and given all unto this Nun) made this <i>Donna Juana de Maldonado</i>
so rich and stately, that at her owne charges shee built for herselfe a new quarter
within the Cloister with roomes and galleries, and a private garden-walke, and kept
at worke and to wait on her halfe a dozen <i>Black-more</i> maids; but above all she placed
her delight in a private Chappel or Closet to pray in, being hung with rich hangings,
and round about it costly lamina's (as they call them) or pictures painted upon brasse
set in blacke Ebony frames with corners of gold, some of silver brought to her from
<i>Rome</i>; her Altar was accordingly decked with Jewels, Candlesticks, Crownes, Lamps,
and covered with a Canopie embroidered with gold; in her Closet she had her small
organ, and many sorts of musicall instruments, whereupon she played sometimes by
herselfe, sometimes with her best friends of the Nuns; and here especially she entertained
with musicke her beloved the Bishop. Her Chappel or place of devotion was
credibly reported about the City to be worth at least six thousand Crownes, which was enough
for a Nun that had vowed chastity, poverty, and obedience. But all this after her decease
she was to leave to the Cloister; and doubtlesse with this State, and riches she would
win more and more the hearts of the common sort of Nuns, till she had made a strong
party, which by this may have made her Abbesse. Thus is ambition and desire of command
and power crept into the walls of Nunneries, like the abominations in the wall of
<i>Ezekiel</i>, and hath possessed the hearts of Nuns, which should be humble, poore, and
mortified Virgins.</p>

<p>But besides this one Nun, there are many more, and also Friers, who are very rich,
for if the City be rich (as is this) and great trading in it, they will be sure to have a
share. Great plenty and wealth hath made the inhabitants as proud and vicious, as are
those of <i>Mexico</i>. Here is not onely Idolatry, but Fornication and uncleannesse as
publike as in any place of the <i>India's</i>: The <i>Mulatto's, Black-mores, Mestica's, Indians</i>,
and all common sort of people are much made on by the greater and richer sort,
and goe as gallantly apparrelled as doe those of <i>Mexico</i>, fearing neither a Vulcan or
mountaine of water on the one side, which they confesse hath once powred out a flood
and river executing Gods wrath against sin there committed; neither a Vulcan of fire,
or mouth of hell on the other side, roaring within and threatning to raine upon them
<i>Sodoms</i> ruine and destruction; neither the weakness of their habitation; lying wide open
on every side, without walls, or workes, or bulwarkes, to defend them, or without
guns, drakes, bullets, or any Ammunition to scare away an approaching enemy, who
may safely come and without resistance upon them who live as professed enemies
of Jesus Christ. This is the City of <i>St. James</i> or <i>Santiago de Guatemala</i>, the head of
a vaste and ample Dominion, which extendeth it selfe nine hundred miles to <i>Nicoya</i>
and <i>Costa Rica</i> South-ward; three hundred miles to <i>Chiapa</i> and <i>Zoques</i> North-ward;
a hundred and fourescore miles to the further parts of <i>Vera Paz</i>, and the <i>Golfo dulce</i>
East-ward; and to the South-sea twenty or thirty, in some places fourty miles West-ward.</p>

<p>From <i>Tecoantepeque</i> (which is no harbour for any great ships) which standeth from
<i>Guatemala</i> at least foure hundred miles, there is no landing place for ships neerer to this
City then is the village <i>de la Trinidad</i>, or of the Trinity. The chiefe commodities
which from along that coast are brought to <i>Guatemala</i>, are from the Provinces of <i>Soconuzco</i>
and <i>Suchutepeques</i>, which are extreame hot, and subject to thunder and lightning,
where groweth scarce any remarkeable commodity, save only <i>Cacao, Achiotte,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<i>Mechasuchil, Bainillas</i> and other drugs for Chocolatte, except it be some <i>Indigo</i> and
<i>Cochinil</i> about <i>St. Antonio</i>, which is the chiefe and head Town of all the <i>Suchutepeques</i>.
But all the coast neer joyning to <i>Guatemala</i>, especially about a Towne called <i>Izquinta</i>,
or <i>Izquintepeque</i> twelve leagues from <i>Guatemala</i>, is absolutely the richest part of the
Dominion of this City; for there is made the greatest part of the <i>Indigo</i> which is sent
from <i>Honduras</i> to <i>Spaine</i>, besides the mighty farmes of Cattel which are all along that
marsh. Though the living there be profitable and the soile rich, yet it is uncomfortable
by reason of the great heat, thundrings and lightnings, especially from <i>May</i> to <i>Michaelmas</i>.
If <i>Guatemala</i> be strong (though not in weapons or Ammunition) in people,
it is strong from hence from a desperate sort of <i>Black-mores</i>, who are slaves in those
Estancia's and farms of <i>Indigo</i>. Though they have no weapons but a Machette, which
is a short Tuck, or lances to run at the wild Cattel, yet with these they are so desperate,
that the City of <i>Guatemala</i> hath often been afraid of them, and the Masters of their
owne slaves and servants. Some of them feare not to encounter a Bull though wild
and mad, and to graple in the rivers (which are many there) with Crocodiles,
or Lagarto's, as there they call them, till they have overmastered them, and brought them
out to land from the water.</p>

<p>This hot, but rich Country runnes on by the Sea side unto the Village of the Trinity,
which (though somewhat dangerous) yet is a haven for ships from <i>Panama, Peru</i>,
and <i>Mexico</i>; It serves to enrich <i>Guatemala</i>, but not to strengthen it, for it hath neither
Fort, nor Bulwarke, nor Castle, nor any Ammunition to defend it selfe. Between this
Village and the other Haven called <i>Realejo</i>, there is a great Creek from the Sea; where
small vessels doe use to come in for fresh water and Victuals to St. <i>Miguel</i> a Towne of
<i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i>, from whence those that travaile to <i>Realejo</i> passe over in lesse
then a day to a Town of <i>Indians</i> called <i>La Vieja</i>, two miles from <i>Realejo</i>, whither the
journey by land from St. <i>Miguel</i> is of at least three daies. But neither this Creeke or
Arme of the Sea is fortified (which might be done with one or two peeces of Ordnance
at most placed at the mouth of the seas entrance) neither is the <i>Realejo</i> strong with any
Ammunition, no nor with people, for it consists not of above two hundred families,
and most of them are <i>Indians</i> and <i>Mestico's</i>, a people of no courage, and very unfit
to defend such an open passage to <i>Guatemala</i> and <i>Nicaragua</i>, which here begins and
continues in small and petty <i>Indian</i> Townes unto <i>Leon</i> and <i>Granada</i>.</p>

<p>On the North side of <i>Guatemala</i> I shall not need to adde to what hath been said of
<i>Suchutepeques</i> and <i>Soconuzco</i>, and my journy that way from <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Chiapa</i>. The
chiefe side of <i>Guatemala</i> is that on the East, which points out the way to the Golfe, or
<i>Golfo dulce</i>, or as others call it <i>St. Thomas de Castilia</i>. This way is more beaten by Mules
and Travellers, then that on the North side, for that <i>Mexico</i> standeth three hundred
leagues from this City, and the Golfe but threescore, and no such passages as are in
some places in the Rode to <i>Mexico</i>. Besides the great trading, commerce, and traffique,
which this City injoyeth by that Golfe from <i>Spaine</i>, hath made that rode exceed
all the rest. In <i>July</i> or at furthest in the beginning of <i>August</i> come into that Golfe
three ships, or two, and frigate, and unlade what they have brought from <i>Spain</i> in <i>Bodega's</i>
or great Lodges, built on purpose to keep dry and from the weather the commodities.
They presently make hast to lade againe from <i>Guatemala</i> those Merchants commodities
of returne, which peradventure have lien waiting for them in the <i>Bodega's</i> two
or three moneths before the ships arrivall. So that these three moneths of <i>July,
August</i> and <i>September</i>, there is sure to be found a great treasure. And O the simplicity
or security of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who appoint no other watch over these their riches, save
only one or two <i>Indians</i> and as many <i>Mulatto's</i>, who commonly are such as have for
their misdemeanours been condemned to live in that old and ruinated Castle of <i>S. Thomas
de Castilia</i>! True it is, above it there is a little and ragged Town of <i>Indians</i>, called <i>S. Pedro</i>,
consisting of some thirty families, who by reason of the exceeding heat, and unhealthinesse
of the air, are alwaies sickly and scarce able to stand upon their legs. But
the weakenesse of this Golfe within might well bee remedied and supplyed at the
mouth of the sea, or entrance into it by one or two at the most good peeces of Ordnance
placed there. For the entrance into this Golfe is but as one should come in at
the doore of some great Palace, where although the dore and entrance be narrow, the
house within is wide and capacious. Such is this Golfe, whose entrance is straitned
with two rocks or mountaines on each side (which would well become two great Peeces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and so scorne a whole fleet, and secure a Kingdome of <i>Guatemala</i>, nay most of all
<i>America</i>) but here being no watch nor defence, the ships come freely and safely in (as
have done some both <i>English</i> and <i>Holland</i> ships) and being entred find a rode and harbour
so wide and capacious as may well secure a thousand ships there riding at anchor,
without any thought of feare from <i>St. Pedro</i>, or <i>Santo Thomas de Castilia</i>. I have often
heard the <i>Spaniards</i> jear and laugh at the <i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i>, for that they having
come into this Golfe, have gone away without attempting any thing further upon
the land. Nay while I lived there, the <i>Hollanders</i> set upon <i>Truxillo</i> the head Port of
<i>Comayagua</i> and <i>Honduras</i>, and tooke it (though there were some resistance) the people
for the most part flying to the woods, trusting more to their feet then to their hands
and weapons (such cowards is all that Countrey full of) and whilst they might have
fortified themselves there and gone into the Countrey, or fortifying that have come on
to the Golfe (all <i>Guatemala</i> fearing it much and not being able to resist them) they
left <i>Truxillo</i> contenting themselves with a small pillage, and gave occasion to the <i>Spaniards</i>
to rejoyce and to make processions of thanksgiving for their safe deliverance out
of their enemies hands.</p>

<p>The way from this Golfe to <i>Guatemala</i> is not so bad as some report and conceive, especially
after <i>Michaelmas</i> untill <i>May</i>, when the winter and rain is past and gone, and
the winds begin to dry up the waies. For in the worst of the yeer Mules laden with
four hundred waight at least goe easily thorow the steepest, deepest, and most dangerous
passages of the mountaines that lie about this Golfe. And though the waies are at
that time of the yeer bad, yet they are so beaten with the Mules, and so wide and open,
that one bad step and passage may be avoided for a better; and the worst of this way
continues but fifteen leagues, there being Rancho's, or Lodges in the way, Cattel and
Mules also among the woods and mountaines, for reliefe and comfort to a weary Traveller.
What the <i>Spaniards</i> most feare untill they come out of these mountaines, are
some two or three hundred <i>Black-mores, Simarrones</i>, who for too much hard usage, have
fled away from <i>Guatemala</i> and other parts from their Masters unto these woods, and
there live and bring up their children and encrease daily, so that all the power of <i>Guatemala</i>,
nay all the Countrey about (having often attempted it) is not able to bring
them under subjection. These often come out to the rode way, and set upon the Requa's
of Mules, and take of Wine, Iron, clothing and weapons from them as much as
they need, without doing any harme unto the people, or slaves that goe with the
Mules; but rather these rejoyce with them, being of one colour, and subject to slavery
and misery which the others have shaken off; by whose example and encouragement
many of these also shake off their misery, and joyne with them to enjoy libertie, though
it be but in the woods and mountaines. Their weapons are bowes and arrows which
they use and carry about them, onely to defend themselves, if the <i>Spaniards</i> set upon
them; else they use them not against the <i>Spaniards</i>, who travell quietly and give them
part of what provision they carry. These have often said that the chiefe cause of their
flying to those mountaines is to be in a readinesse to joyne with the <i>English</i> or <i>Hollanders</i>,
if ever they land in that Golfe; for they know, from them they may
injoy that liberty which the <i>Spaniards</i> will never grant unto them. After the first fifteen
leagues the way is better, and there are little Towns and villages of <i>Indians</i>, who
relieve with provision both man and beast. Fifteen leagues further is a great Town of
<i>Indians</i>, called <i>Acasabastlan</i>, standing upon a river, which for fish is held the best all that
Country. Though here are many sorts, yet above all there is one which they call Bobo,
a thick round fish as long or longer then a mans arme, with onely a middle bone,
as white as milke, at fat as butter, and good to boil, fry, stew or bake. There is also from
hence most of the way to <i>Guatemala</i> in brooks and shallow rivers, one of the best sort
of fishes in the world, which the <i>Spaniards</i> judge to be a kind of Trout, it is called there
Tepemechin, the fat whereof resembles veal more than fish.</p>

<p>This Towne of <i>Acasabastlan</i> is governed by a <i>Spaniard</i> who is called Corrigidor;
his power extendeth no farther then to the Golfe, and to those Townes in the
way. This Governour hath often attempted to bring in those <i>Simarrones</i> from the
mountaines, but could never prevaile against them. All the strength of this place may
bee some twenty muskets (for so many <i>Spanish</i> houses there may bee in the Towne) and
some few <i>Indians</i> that use bowes and arrowes, for the defence of the Town against the
<i>Blackmore Simarrones</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>About <i>Acasabastlan</i>, there are many Estancia's of Cattell and Mules, much Cacao,
Achiotte, and drugs for Chocolatte; There is also Apothecary drugs, as <i>Zarzaparilla</i>,
and <i>Canna fistula</i>, and in the Town as much variety of fruits and gardens, as in any
one <i>Indian</i> Town in the Country; But above all <i>Acasabastlan</i>, is farre known, and
much esteemed of in the City of <i>Guatemala</i>, for excellent Muskmillians, some small,
some bigger then a mans head, wherewith the <i>Indians</i> load their mules and carry
them to sell all over the Country. From hence to <i>Guatemala</i>, there are but
thirty short leagues, and though some hills there be, ascents and descent, yet nothing
troublesome to man or beast. Among these Mountaines there have beene discovered
some mines of metall, which the <i>Spaniards</i> have begun to digge, and finding that
they have been some of Copper, and some of iron, they have let them alone, judgeing
them more chargeable then profitable. But greater profit have the <i>Spaniards</i> lost,
then of iron and copper, for using the poore <i>Indians</i> too hardly, and that in this
way, from <i>Acasabastlan</i> to <i>Guatemala</i>, especially about a place called, <i>el Agua Caliente</i>,
the hot water, where is a River, out of which in some places formerly the <i>Indians</i> found
such store of gold, that they were charged by the <i>Spaniards</i> with a yeerly tribute of
gold. But the <i>Spaniards</i> being like <i>Valdivia</i> in <i>Chille</i>, too greedy after it, murthering
the <i>Indians</i> for not discovering unto them whereabout this treasure lay, have lost both
treasure and <i>Indians</i> also. Yet unto this day search is made about the Mountaines,
the River, and the sands for the hidden treasure, which peradventure by Gods order
and appointment, doth and shall lie hide, and kept for a people better knowing and
honouring their God. At this place called <i>el Agua Caliente</i>, or the hot water, liveth
a Blackmore in an Estancia of his own, who is held to be very rich, and gives good entertainement
to the Travellers that passe that way; he is rich in Cattell, Sheep, and Goates,
and from his Farm stores <i>Guatemala</i> and the people thereabout with the best Cheese of
all that Country. But his riches are thought not so much to increase from his Farm
and cheeses, but from this hidden treasure, which credibly is reported to be known
unto him. He hath been questioned about it in the Chancery of <i>Guatemala</i>, but hath
denyed often any such treasure to be known unto him. The jealousie and suspicion
of him, is, for that formerly having been a slave, hee bought his freedome with great
summes of money, and since hee hath been free, hath bought that farm and much
land lying to it, and hath exceedingly increased his stock; To which hee answereth,
that when hee was young and a slave, hee had a good Master, who let him get for
himself what hee could, and that hee playing the good husband, gathered as much
as would buy his liberty, and at first a little house to live in, to the which God hath
since given a blessing with a greater increase of stock. From this hot water three
or foure leagues, there is another River called, <i>Rio de las Vaccas</i>, or the River of <i>Cowes</i>,
where are a company of poore and country people most of them Mestizo's, and Mulatto's,
who live in thatched houses, with some small stock of Cattell, spending their
time also in searching for sands of Gold, hoping that one day by their diligent
search they and their children, and all their Country shall bee inriched, and that
<i>Rio de las Vaccas</i>, shall parallel <i>Pactolus</i>, and stirre up the wits of Poets to speak of it as
much as ever they have spoke of that. From this River is presently discovered the
pleasantest valley in all that Country, (where my selfe did live at least five yeers) called
the Valley of <i>Mixco</i>, and <i>Pinola</i>, lying six leagues from <i>Guatemala</i>, being fifteen miles
in length, and ten or twelve in breadth; Out of the inclosures this Valley is stored with
sheep; the ground inclosed is divided into many Farmes, where groweth better wheat
then any in the Country of <i>Mexico</i>. From this Valley the city is well provided of
wheat, and Bisket is made for the ships that come every yeere unto the Golf. It is
called the Valley of <i>Mixco</i>, and <i>Pinola</i> from two Townes of <i>Indians</i>, so called, standing
opposite the one to the other on each side of the Valley, <i>Pinola</i>, on the left side from <i>Rio
de las Vaccas</i>, and <i>Mixco</i> on the right. Here do live many rich Farmers, but yet Country
and clownish people, who know more of breaking clods of earth, then of managing
Armes offensive or defensive. But among them I must not forget one friend of mine,
called <i>Juan Palomeque</i>, whom I should have more esteemed of then I did if I could have
prevailed with him to have made him live more like a man then a beast, more like a free
man then a bond slave to his gold and silver. This man had in my time three hundred
lusty mules trained up in the way of the Golf, which hee divided into six Requa's, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
companies, and for them he kept above a hundred <i>Black-more</i> slaves, men, women, and
children, who lived neer <i>Mixco</i> in severall thatched cottages. The house he
lived in himselfe was but a poore thatched house, wherein he tooke more delight to live
then in other houses which he had in <i>Guatemala</i>, for there hee lived like a wilde
<i>Simarron</i> among his slaves and <i>Black-mores</i>, whereas in the City he should have lived
civilly; there he lived with milke, curds, and blacke, hard and mouldy bisket,
and with a dry tassajo, which is dry salted beefe cut out in thinne slices, and
dryed in the sun and wind, till there be little substance left in it, such as his slaves were
wont to cary to the Golfe for their provision by the way, whereas if he had lived in
the City, he must have eat for his credit what others of worth did eat. But the miser
knew well, which was the best way to save, and so chose a field for a City, a cottage
for a house, company of <i>Simarrones</i> and <i>Black-mores</i> for Citizens, and yet he was
thought to be worth six hundred thousand duckats. He was the undoer of all others
who dealed with Mules for bringing and carrying commodities to the Golfe for the
Merchants; for he having lusty Mules, lusty slaves, would set the price or rate for the
hundred weight so, as he might get, but others at that rate hiring <i>Indians</i> and servants
to goe with their Mules, might lose. He was so cruell to his <i>Black-mores</i>, that if
any were untoward, he would torment them almost to death; amongst whom he had
one slave called <i>Macaco</i> (for whom I have often interceded, but to little purpose) whom
he would often hang up by the armes, and whip him till the blood ran about his back,
and then his flesh being torne, mangled, and all in a goar blood, he would for last cure
powre boyling grease upon it; he had marked him for a slave with burning irons upon
his face, his hands, his armes, his back, his belly, his thighes, his legs, that the
poor slave was weary of life, and I thinke would two or three times have hanged himselfe,
if I had not counselled him to the contrary. He was so sensuall and carnall
that he would use his own slaves wives at his pleasure; nay when he met in the City any
of that kind handsome and to his liking, if she would not yeeld to his desire, he
would goe to her master or mistresse, and buy her, offering far more then she was worth,
boasting that he would pull downe her proud and haughty lookes, with one yeers slavery
under him. He killed in my time two <i>Indians</i> in the way to the Golfe, and with
his mony came off, as if he had killed but a dog. He would never marry, because his
slaves supplyed the bed of a wife, and none of his neighbours durst say him nay;
whereby he hasted to fill that valley with bastards of all sorts and colours, by whom,
when that rich miser dieth, all his wealth and treasure is like to be consumed.</p>

<p>Besides the two Townes which denominate this valley, there standeth at the East
end of it close by the <i>Rio de las Vaccas</i> an Ermitage, called <i>Nostra Sennora del Carmel</i>,
or our Lady of <i>Carmel</i>, which is the Parish Church to all those severall farmes of <i>Spaniards</i>
living in the valley; though true it is, most constantly they doe resort unto the
<i>Indian</i> Townes to Masse, and in <i>Mixco</i> especially, the <i>Spaniards</i> have a rich sodality
of our Lady of the Rosary, and the <i>Black-mores</i> another. In all the valley there may
be between fourty and fifty <i>Spanish</i> farmes or houses belonging to the Ermitage, and
in all these houses, some three hundred slaves, men and women, <i>Black-mores</i> and <i>Mulatto's.
Mixco</i> is a town of three hundred families, but in it nothing considerable, but the
riches belonging unto the two forenamed Sodalities, and some rich <i>Indians</i>, who have
learned of the <i>Spaniards</i> to break clods of earth, and to sow wheat, and to traffique with
Mules unto the Golfe. Besides what fowles and great store of Turkeys which in this
Towne are bred, there is a constant slaughter house, where meat is sold to the <i>Indians</i>
within, and to the farmes without, and provision is made for all the Requa's and
slaves that go to the Golfe with their masters Mules. Besides the six Requa's before named
of <i>Juan Palomeque</i>, there are in this valley four brothers, named <i>Don Gaspar,
Don Diego, Don Thomas, Don Juan de Colindres</i>, who have each of them a Requa of
threescore Mules (though few slaves, and onely hired <i>Indians</i> to goe with them) to
traffique to the Golfe, and over all the Country as far as <i>Mexico</i> sometimes. Yet besides
these there are some six more Requa's belonging to other farms, which with those
of the Towne of <i>Mixco</i> may make up full twenty Requa's; and those twenty Requa's
containe above a thousand Mules, which only from this valley are imployed to all
parts of the Country by the rich Merchants of <i>Guatemala</i>. But to returne againe to
the Towne of <i>Mixco</i>, the constant passage thorow it of these Requa's, of rich Merchants,
of all passengers that goe and come from <i>Spain</i>, hath made it very rich; whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
in the Town it self there is no other commodity, except it be a kind of earth, whereof
are made rare and excellent pots for water, pans, pipkins, platters, dishes, chafing-dishes,
warming-pans, wherein those <i>Indians</i> shew much wit, and paint them
with red, white, and severall mingled colours, and sell them to <i>Guatemala</i>, and the
Towns about, which some Criolian women will eat by full mouth fulls, endangering
their health and lives, so that by this earthly ware they may looke white and pale.
The Towne of <i>Pinola</i> in bignesse is much like unto <i>Mixco</i>, but a far pleasanter Town,
more healthy and better seated, standing upon a plain, whereas <i>Mixco</i> stands on the
side on a hill, which carrieth the Travellers quite out of the sight of the valley. In <i>Pinola</i>
there is also a slaughter house, where beef is dayly sold, there is plenty of fowles,
Fruits, Maiz, Wheat, (though not altogether so bright as that of <i>Mixco</i>) hony, and
the best water thereabouts; it is called in the <i>Indian</i> tongue <i>Panac</i>, (some say) from a
fruit of that name which is very abundant there. On the North and South side of
this valley are hils, which are most sown with wheat, which proveth better there then
in the low valley. At the West end of it, stand two greater Townes then <i>Mixco</i> and
<i>Pinola</i>, named <i>Petapa</i>, and <i>Amatitlan</i>, to the which there are in the midst of the valley
some descents and ascents, which they call Baranca's or bottomes, where are pleasant
streames and fountaines, and good feeding for sheep, and Cattel.</p>

<p><i>Petapa</i> is a Towne of at least five hundred inhabitants very rich, who suffer also
some <i>Spaniards</i> to dwell amongst them, from whom also those <i>Indians</i> have learned to
live and thrive in the world. This Towne is the passage from <i>Comayagua, St. Salvador,
Nicaragua</i>, and <i>Costa Rica</i>, and hath got great wealth by the constant goers and
comers. It is esteemed one of the pleasantest Townes belonging unto <i>Guatemala</i>, for
a great Lake of fresh water neer unto it, which is full of fish, especially crabs, and a
fish called, Mojarra, which is much like unto a mullet (though not altogether so big)
and eateth like it. In this Towne there is a certaine number of <i>Indians</i> appointed,
who are to fish for the City, and on Wednesdayes, Fridayes, and Saturdayes, are
bound to carry such a quantity to <i>Guatemala</i>, of Crabs and Mojarra's, as the Corregidor
and Regidores, Major and Aldermen (who are but eight) shall command weekly
to be brought.</p>

<p>This Towne <i>Petapa</i> is so called from two <i>Indian</i> words, <i>Petap</i>, which signifieth a
Mat, and <i>ha</i>, which signifieth water, and a Mat being the chiefe part of an <i>Indians</i>
bed, it is as much as to say a bed of water, from the smoothnesse, plainnesse, and calmnesse
of the water of the Lake. There liveth in it a principall family of <i>Indians</i>, who
are said to descend from the ancient Kings of those parts, and now by the <i>Spaniards</i>
are graced with the noble name of <i>Guzman</i>; out of this family is chosen one to be
Governour of the Towne with subordination unto the City and Chancery of <i>Guatemala.
Don Bernabe de Guzman</i> was Governour in my time, and had been many yeers
before, and governed very wisely and discreetly, till with old age he came to loose his
sight; and in his place entred his son <i>Don Pedro de Guzman</i>, of whom the rest of the
<i>Indians</i> stood in great awe, as formerly they had to his father. Had not these <i>Indians</i>
been given to drunkennesse (as most <i>Indians</i> are) they might have governed a
Town of <i>Spaniards</i>. This Governour hath many priviledges granted unto him (though
none to weare a sword, or rapier, as may the Governour of <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>)
and appoints by turnes some of the Towne to wait and attend on him at dinner and
supper, others to looke to his Horses, others to fish for him, others to bring him
wood for his house spending, others to bring him meat for his Horses; and yet after
all this his attendance, he attends and waits on the Frier that lives in the Towne, and
doth nothing concerning the governing of the Towne and executing of justice, but
what the Frier alloweth and adviseth to be done. There is also great service appointed
for this Frier, of Fishermen, and other attendants in his house, who liveth as stately
as any Bishop. Most trades belonging to a well setled Common-wealth are here exercised
by these <i>Indians</i>. As for herbage, and garden-fruits, and requisites, it hath whatsoever
may be found, or desired in the City of <i>Guatemala</i>. The Church treasure is very
great, there being many Sodalities of our Lady and other their Saints, which are enriched
with crowns, and chains, and bracelets, besides the lamps, censers, &amp; silver candlesticks
belonging unto the Altars. Upon <i>Michaelmas</i> day is the chief fair and feast of the
Town, which is dedicated unto St. <i>Michael</i>, whither many Merchants resort from <i>Guatemala</i>
to buy and sell; in the afternoon, and the next day following, Bull-baiting is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
common sport for that feast with some <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Blackmores</i> on Horse-backe, and
other <i>Indians</i> on foot, who commonly being drunke, some venture, some lose their
lives in the sport. Besides this generall concourse of people every yeer at that time,
there is every day at five a clock in the afternoone a Tianguez or market, upheld by the
concourse of the <i>Indians</i> of the Town among themselves. Besides the lake, there runneth
by this Town a river, which in places is easily waded over, and waters the fruits,
gardens, and other plantations, and drives a mill which serves most of the valley to
grind their wheat. Within a mile and a halfe of this Towne there is a rich Ingenio
or farme of Sugar belonging to one <i>Sebastian de Savaletta</i>, a <i>Biscaine</i> borne, who came
at first very poore into that Country, and served one of his Country men; but with
his good industry and paines, he began to get a Mule or two to traffique with about
the Country, till at last he increased his stocke to a whole Requa of Mules, and from
thence grew so rich that he bought much land about <i>Petapa</i>, which he found to be very
fit for Sugar, and from thence was incouraged to build a princely house, whither
the best of <i>Guatemala</i> doe resort for their recreation. This man maketh a great deale
of Sugar for the Country, and sends every yeer much to <i>Spaine</i>; he keepeth at least
threescore slaves of his own for the worke of his farme, is very generous in house keeping,
and is thought to be worth above five hundred thousand Duckats. Within halfe
a mile from him there is another farme of Sugar, which is called but a <i>Trapiche</i>
belonging unto the Augustin Friers of <i>Guatemala</i>, which keepes some twenty slaves,
and is called a <i>Trapiche</i>, for that it grinds not the Sugar Cane with that device of the
Ingenio, but grinds a lesse quantity, and so makes not to much Sugar as doth an Ingenio.
From hence three miles is the Town of <i>Amatitlan</i>, neer unto which standeth
a greater Ingenio of Sugar, then is that of <i>Savaletta</i>, and is called the Ingenio of one
<i>Anis</i>, because he first founded it, but now it belongeth unto one <i>Pedro Crespo</i> the Post-master
of <i>Guatemala</i>; this Ingenio seemeth to be a little Town by it selfe for the many
cottages and thatched houses of <i>Blackmore</i> slaves which belong unto it, who may be
above a hundred, men, women, and children. The chiefe dwelling house is strong
and capacious, and able to entertain a hundred lodgers. These three farmes of Sugar
standing so neer unto <i>Guatemala</i>, enrich the City much, and occasion great trading
from it to <i>Spaine</i>. The Town of <i>Amatitlan</i>, though in it there live not so many <i>Spaniards</i>
as in <i>Petapa</i>, yet there are in it more <i>Indian</i> families then in <i>Petapa</i>. The streets
are more orderly made and framed like a Chequer board, they are wide, broad, plain,
and all upon dust and sand. This Towne also enjoyeth the commodity of the lake,
and furnisheth with fish the City of <i>Guatemala</i>, upon those daies before named of <i>Petapa</i>.
And though it standeth out of the rode-way, yet it is almost as rich as <i>Petapa</i>.
For the <i>Indians</i> of it get much by the concourse of common people, and the Gentry
of <i>Guatemala</i>, who resort thither to certain bathes of hot waters, which are judged
and approved very wholesome for the body. This Towne also getteth much by the
salt which here is made, or rather gathered by the lake side, which every morning appeareth
like a hoary frost upon the ground, and is taken up and purified by the <i>Indians</i>,
and proves very white and good. Besides what they get by the salt, they get also by
the Requa's of Mules in the valley, and about the Country, which are brought
to feed upon that salt earth a day, or halfe a day, untill they be ready to burst (the owner
paying six pence a day for every Mule) and it hath been found by experience,
that this makes them thrive and grow lusty and purgeth them better then any drench,
or blood-letting. They have further great trading in Cotton-wool, more abundance
of fruits then <i>Petapa</i>, a fairer market place with two extraordinary great Elm-trees,
under which the <i>Indians</i> daily meet at evening to buy and sell. The Church of this
Towne is as faire and beautifull as any about <i>Guatemala</i>, the riches and state whereof
hath caused the Dominican Friers since the yeer 1635, to make that place the head and
Priory over the other Townes of the valley, and to build there a goodly and sumptuous
Cloister, in which in my time there was (for I told then most of it, and doubtlesse since
it hath much increased) eight thousand Duckats laid up in a chest, with three lockes for
the common expences of the Cloister. Thus my Reader, I have led thee through the valley
of <i>Mixco</i>, and <i>Pinola, Petapa</i> and <i>Amatitlan</i>, which in riches and wealth, what with
the great trading in it, what with the sheep &amp; cattell, what with the abundance of mules,
what with three Farmes of Sugar, what with the great Farmes of Corn and Wheat,
what with the churches treasures yeelds to no other place belonging unto the dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of <i>Guatemala</i>. I may not forget yet a double wheat harvest (as I may well term it) in this
Vally. The first being of a little kinde of Wheat, which they call <i>Trigo Tremesino</i>, a word
compounded in <i>Spanish</i> from these two words, <i>tres meses</i>, or from the Latin <i>tres menses</i>,
which after three moneths sowing is ripe and ready to be cut down, and being sowed
about the end of <i>August</i>, is commonly harvested in about the end of <i>November</i>; and
although in the smalnesse of it, it seemes to have but a little Flower, yet it yeelds as
much as their other sorts of Wheat, and makes as white bread, though it keep not so
well as that which is made of other Wheat, but soone groweth stale and hard. The
other harvest (which is of two sorts of Wheat, one called <i>Rubio</i>, or red Wheat, the other
called <i>Blanquilleo</i>, or white like <i>Candia</i> Wheat) followeth soon after this first of
<i>Tremesino</i>, for presently after Christmas every one begins to bring their sickles into
the field, where they doe not onely reap down their Wheat, but in stead of threshing
it in barnes, they cause it to bee trod by Mares inclosed within floores made on purpose
in the fields; and when the Wheat is trod out of the Eares by the Mares trampling,
who are whipped round about the floores that they may not stand still, but tread
it constantly and throughly; then the Mares being let out of the floores, the wheat is
winnowed from the chaffe, and put up clean into sackes, and from the field carried to
the Barnes; but the chaffe and most of the straw is left to rot in the fields, which they
esteem as good as dunging; and further set all the fields on fire, burning the stubble
that is left a little before the time of the first showers of raine, which with the ashes
left after the burning fatteth the ground, and by them is held the best way to husband
or dung their ground. Others that will sow a new and woody peece of land,
cause the trees, though timber trees to bee cut down, and sell not a stick of that wood,
(which there is so plentifull, that they judge it would not quit their cost to carry it
to <i>Guatemala</i>, though in <i>England</i> it would yeeld thousand pounds) but they let it
lie and dry, and before the winter raine begins, they set on fire all the field, and
burn that rich timber, with the ashes whereof that ground becomes so fat and fertile,
that where upon an Aker wee sow here three bushels of Wheat, or upwards, they
sow such ground so thin, that they scarce dare venture a full bushell upon an Aker,
lest with too much spreading upon the ground it grow too thick, bee lodged, and
they loose their crop. The like they doe unto the pasture of the Valley; about the
end of <i>March</i>, it is short and withered and dry, and they also set it on fire, which being
burnt causeth a dismall sight, and prospect of a black valley; but after the first
two or three showres, it puts on againe its greene and pleasant garment, inviting the
Cattell, Sheep, Lambs, Goats, and Kids, (which for a while were driven away to other
pasturing) to return and sport againe, to feed and rest in its new flourishing bosome.
But now it is time, I return again back to the other end of this valley, to the
<i>Rio de las Vaccas</i> (from whence I have viewed the compasse of it, and made my long
digression from East to West, to the farthest Towne of <i>Amatitlan</i>) to shew thee, my
Reader, the little part of thy way remaining unto <i>Guatemala</i>. True it is, from the
Ermitage of our Lady, there is a streight way through the middle of the valley leading
almost to <i>Amatitlan</i>, and then turning up a hill out of the valley on the right hand; But
that hath many ascents and descents, bottomes, falls and risings, and therefore is not
the constant Rode, which from the Ermitage pointeth on the right hand, observing
the Towne of <i>Mixco</i>, standing but five miles from <i>Guatemala</i>, from <i>Mixco</i> the way
lyeth up a hill, and leadeth to a Town somewhat bigger then <i>Mixco</i>, of <i>Indians</i> called
<i>San Lucas</i>, or St. <i>Luke</i>, a cold Town, but exceeding rich; the temper and coldnesse
of it, hath made it the storehouse, or Granary for all the City; for whereas below
in the Valley; the Wheat will not keep long without musting, and breeding a worm
called <i>Gurgojo</i>, such is the temper of this Town of St. <i>Luke</i>, that in it, the Wheat will keep
two or three yeeres ready threshed, with a little turning now and then; and as it lyeth
will give and yeeld, (as experience taught mee there) so that he that hath laid up in that
Town two hundred bushels of Wheat, at the yeers end shall find neer upon two hundred
and twenty bushels. This Towne therefore receives from the Valley most of
the harvest, and is full of what wee call Barnes, but there are called <i>Trojas</i>, without
floore, but raised up with stackes and bords a foot or two from the ground, and
covered with mats, whereon is laid the Wheat, and by some rich Monopolists from
the City is kept and hoarded two and three yeers, untill they find their best opportunity
to bring it out to sale, at the rate of their own will and pleasure. From hence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<i>Guatemala</i> there is but three little leagues, and one onely <i>Barranca</i>, or bottome, and
on every side of the way little petty Townes, which they call <i>Milpas</i>, consisting of
some twenty Cottages. In the middle of the way is the top of a hill, which discovereth
all the City, and standeth as overmastring of it, as if with a peece or two of Ordnance
it would keepe all <i>Guatemala</i> in awe; But besides this hill, which is the wide and open
Rode, there stand yet forwarder on the right and left hand other mountaines
which draw neerer to the City, and what this top peradventure with too much distance,
is not able to doe or reach, the others certainly would reach with Cannon shot,
and command that farre commanding City. Downe this hill the way lies broad and
wide, and as open as is the way downe <i>Barnet</i> or <i>Highgate</i> Hill; and at the bottome
it is more straitned betweene the Mountaines, for the space of a bowshot, which passage
also is craggy by reason of stones and some small peeces of rocks which lie in a
brook of water that descends from the Mountaines, and runs towards the City. But
at a little Ermitage called St. <i>John</i>, the way opens againe itselfe, and sheweth <i>Guatemala</i>,
welcoming the weary travellers with a pleasant prospect, and easing theirs, or
their mules or horses feet, what with green walkes, what with a sandy and gravelly
Rode unto the City, which never shut gate against any goer or comer, nor forbad
their entrance with any fenced walls, or watchmens jealous questions, but freely
and gladly entertaines them either by the back side of the Dominicans Cloister, or by
the Church and Nunnery called the Conception. And thus my Reader, and country
man I have brought and guided thee from the Golfe unto <i>Guatemala</i>, shewing what
that way is most remarkable. I shall not now shew thee any more of this Cities Dominions
toward <i>Nicaragua</i> and the South (having already shewed thee the way as far
as <i>Realejo</i>) leaving that untill I come to tell thee of my journey homewards, which I
made that way. There remaines yet the Country of the <i>Vera Paz</i> and the way unto
it to discover, and so to close up this Chapter. The <i>Vera Paz</i> is so called, for that the
<i>Indians</i> of that Country hearing how the <i>Spaniards</i> had conquered <i>Guatemala</i>, and did
conquer the Country round about, wheresoever they came, yeelded themselves peaceably
and without any resistance unto the Government of <i>Spaine</i>. This Country formerly
had a Bishop to it selfe distinct from <i>Guatemala</i>, but now is made one Bishoprick
with that. It is governed by an Alcalde Maior, or high Justice sent from <i>Spain</i>, with subordination
unto the Court of <i>Guatemala</i>. The head or shire Town of it, is called <i>Coban</i>,
where is a Cloister of Dominican Friers, and the common place of Residence of the
Alcalde Maior. All this Country as yet is not subdued by the <i>Spaniards</i>, who have
now and then some strong encounters with the barbarous and heathen people, which
lie between this Country and <i>Jucatan</i>; and faine would the <i>Spaniards</i> conquer
them, that they might make way through them unto a Town called <i>Campin</i> belonging
to <i>Jucatan</i>, and settle commerce, and Traffique by land with that Country,
which is thought would bee a great furtherance to the Country and City of <i>Guatemala</i>,
and a safer way to convey their goods to the Havana, then by the Golf, for oftentimes
the ships that goe from the Golf to the Havana, are met with by the <i>Hollanders</i>
and surprised. But as yet the <i>Spaniards</i> have not been able to bring to passe this their
design, by reason they have found strong resistance from the heathenish people, and
a hot service to attempt the conquering of them. Yet there was a Fryer a great
acquaintance of mine, called Fryer <i>Francisco Moran</i>, who ventured his life among those
barbarians, and with two or three <i>Indians</i> went on foot through that Country, untill
he came unto <i>Campin</i>, where he found a few <i>Spaniards</i>, who wondred at his courage and
boldnesse in comming that way. This Fryer came back again to <i>Coban</i> and <i>Vera Paz</i>,
relating how the barbarians hearing him speake their language, and finding him
kind, loving and curteous to them, used him also kindly, fearing (as hee said) that if
they should kill him, the <i>Spaniards</i> would never let them bee at rest and quiet, untill
they had utterly destroyed them. Hee related when he came back, that the Country
which the Barbarians inhabite, is better then any part of the <i>Vera Paz</i>, which is
subject to the <i>Spaniards</i>, and spoke much of a Valley, where is a great lake, and about
it a Towne of <i>Indians</i>, which hee judged to bee of at least twelve thousand Inhabitants,
the Cottages lying in a distance one from another. This Fryer hath writ
of this Country, and hath gone to <i>Spain</i> to the Court to motion the conquering of
it, for the profit and commodity that may ensue both to <i>Guatemala</i> and <i>Jucatan</i>, if
a way were opened thither. But though as yet on that side the <i>Spaniards</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Country of the <i>Vera Paz</i>, bee straightned by that heathenish people, yet on the other
side it hath free passage unto the Golf, and trade there when the ships doe come,
carrying Fowles and what other Provision the Country will afford for the ships,
and bringing from thence wines, and other <i>Spanish</i> wares unto <i>Coban</i>. This Country
is very hilly and craggy, and though there bee some bigge Townes in it, they are
not above three or foure that are considerable. The chief commodities, are <i>Achiotte</i>
(which is the best of all the Country belonging to <i>Guatemala</i>) and <i>Cacao</i>, Cotton
Wooll, hony, <i>Canna fistula</i>, and <i>Zarzaparilla</i>, great store of <i>Maiz</i>, but no Wheat,
much waxe, plenty of fowles and birds of all coloured feathers, wherewith the <i>Indians</i>
make some curious works, but not like unto those of <i>Mechoacan</i>; here are also abundance
of Parrets, Apes and Monkies which breed in the Mountaines. The way from <i>Guatemala</i>
to this Country is that which hitherto hath beene spoken of from the Golf,
as far as the Town of St. <i>Luke</i>; and from thence the way keeps on the hils and mountaines
which lie on the side of the Valley of <i>Mixco</i>. These hils are called <i>Sacatepeques</i>,
(compounded of <i>Sacate</i> and <i>Tepec</i>, the latter signifying a hill, and the former, herbe
or grasse, and thus joyned, they signifie mountaines of grasse) and among them are
these chief Townes, first <i>Santiago</i> or St. <i>James</i>, a Town of five hundred Families, secondly,
<i>San Pedro</i> or St. <i>Peter</i>, consisting of six hundred families, thirdly, St. <i>Juan</i>,
or St. <i>John</i> consisting also of at least six hundred Families, and fourthly, <i>Sto Domingo Senano</i>,
or St. <i>Dominic</i> of <i>Senaco</i>, being of three hundred Families. These foure Towns
are very rich, and the two last very cold, the two first are warmer; there are about
them many Farmes of corn and good Wheat, besides the <i>Indian Maiz</i>. These <i>Indians</i>
are somewhat of more courage then those of other Townes, and in my time
were like to rise up against the <i>Spaniards</i> for their unmercifull tyranny over them. The
Churches are exceeding rich; in the Towne of <i>Santiago</i>, there was living in my time
one <i>Indian</i>, who for onely vaine-glory had bestowed the worth of six thousand Duckates
upon that Church, and yet afterwards this wretch was found to bee a Wizard
and Idolater. These <i>Indians</i> get much mony by letting out great tuffes of feathers,
which the <i>Indians</i> use in their dances upon the feasts of the Dedication of their towns.
For some of the great tuffes may have at least threescore long feathers of divers colours,
for every feather hiring they have halfe a Riall, besides what price they set to every
feather, if any should chance to be lost. From the Town of St. <i>John</i>, which is the furthest
the way lies plain and pleasant unto a little village of some twenty Cottages, called
St. <i>Raymundo</i> or St. <i>Raymond</i>, from whence there is a good dayes journy up and down
<i>Barrancas</i>, or bottomes unto a <i>Rancho</i>, or lodge standing by a River side, which is
the same River, that passeth by the Town of <i>Acasabastlan</i> spoken of before. From
this is an ascent of a very craggy and rocky Mountaine, called the Mountaine of
<i>Rabinall</i>, where are steps cut out in the very Rockes for the mules feet, and slipping
on one or the other side, they fall surely downe the rockes, breaking their neckes, and
mangling all their limbes and joynts; but this danger continueth not long nor
extendeth above a league and a half, and in the top and worst of this danger, there
is the comfort of a goodly Valley, called <i>El Valle de San Nicholas</i>, St. <i>Nicholas</i> his Valley,
from an Estancia called St. <i>Nicholas</i> belonging to the Dominicans Cloister of <i>Coban</i>.
This Valley though it must not compare with that of <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>; yet next
after it, it may well take place for onely three things considerable in it. The first
is an <i>Ingenio</i> of Sugar, called <i>San Geronymo</i>, or St. <i>Hierome</i>, belonging unto the Dominicans
Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>, which indeed goeth beyond that spoken of of <i>Amatitlan</i>,
both for abundance of Sugar made there, and sent by mules to <i>Guatemala</i> over that
rocky Mountaine, and for multitude of slaves living in it under the command of two
Fryers, and for the excellent horses bred there, which are incomparably the
best of all the Country of <i>Guatemala</i> for metle, and gallantry, and therefore (though
mules are commonly used for burthens) are much desired and looked after by the Gallants
and Gentry of the City, who make it a great part of their honour to prance about
the streets. The second thing in this Valley is the Estancia or Farm of St. <i>Nicolas</i>
which is as famous for breeding of mules, as is St. <i>Hierome</i> for horses. The third ornament
to it is a Town of <i>Indians</i>, called <i>Rabinall</i>, of at least eight hundred Families,
which hath all that heart can wish for pleasure and life of man. It inclineth rather
to heat then cold, but the heat is moderate and much qualified with the many cool
and shady walkes. There is not any <i>Indian</i> fruit, which is not there to be found, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the fruits of <i>Spain</i>, as Oranges, Lemmons, sweet and sowre, Citrons, Pomegranates,
Grapes, Figs, Almonds, and Dates; the onely want of wheat is not a want to
them that mind bread of wheat more then of Maiz, for in two dayes it is easily brought
from the Townes of <i>Sacatepeques</i>. For flesh, it hath Beef, Mutton, Kid, Fowles, Turkies,
Quailes, Partridges, Rabbets, Pheasants; and for fish, it hath a River running by the
houses, which yeeldeth plenty both great and small. The <i>Indians</i> of this Towne
are much like unto those of <i>Chiapa</i> of the <i>Indians</i>, for bravery, for feasting, for riding of
horses, and shewing themselves in sports and pastimes. This Town my friend Fryer
<i>John Baptist</i>, after hee had been Prior of many places, and especially of <i>Chiapa</i> and
<i>Guatemala</i>, chose to live in to injoy quietnesse, pleasure and content; and in this Town
was I feasted by him in such a sumptuous, prodigall and lavishing way, as truely might
make poor mendicant Fryers ashamed to come so neer unto Princes in vanity of life and
dyet. From this Valley unto the <i>Vera Paz</i>, or <i>Coban</i>, the head Town of it, there is
nothing considerable, save onely one Town more called St. <i>Christoval</i> or St. <i>Christopher</i>,
which enjoyeth now a pleasant Lake, and bottomelesse, as is reported. Formerly there
being no Lake at all, in a great Earthquake, the earth there opened, and swallowed up
many houses, leaving this Lake which ever since hath continued. From hence to <i>Coban</i>
the wayes are bad and mountainous, yet such as through the worst of them, those country
mules with heavy burthens easily goe through. And thus with my pen, Reader, have
I gone through most of the bounds and limits of <i>Guatemala</i>, which is more furnished
with gallant Towns of <i>Indians</i>, then is any part of all <i>America</i>; and doubtlesse were
the <i>Indians</i> warlike, industrious, active for warre or weapons, no part in all <i>America</i>
might bee stronger in people then <i>Guatemala</i>. But they being kept under and oppressed
by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and no weapons allowed them, not so much as their naturall
Bowes and Arrowes, much lesse Guns, Pistols, Muskets, Swords, or Pikes, their
courage is gone, their affections alienated from the <i>Spaniards</i>, and so the <i>Spaniards</i>
might very well feare, that if their country should be invaded, the multitude of their <i>Indian</i>
people, would prove to them a multitude of enemies, either running away to another
side; or forced to help, would bee to them but as the help of so many flies.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XIX" id="CHAP_XIX">CHAP. XIX.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing the condition, quality, fashion, and behaviour of the</i> Indians <i>of the
Country of</i> Guatemala <i>since the Conquest, and especially of their feasts, and
yeerly Solemnities.</i></h4>


<p>The condition of the <i>Indians</i> of this Country of <i>Guatemala</i> is as sad, and as
much to bee pitied as of any <i>Indians</i> in <i>America</i>, for that I may say it is with
them in some sort, as it was with <i>Israel</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, of whom it is said, <i>Exod.</i> 1. 7.
<i>They were fruitfull and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding
mighty, and the land was filled with them</i>, and therefore <i>Pharaoh</i> said unto his people,
Vers. 10. <i>Let us deale wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to passe, that when
there falleth out any Warre, they joyne also unto our enemies, and fight against us</i>. Therefore
they did set over them taskemasters, to afflict them with their burdens, and
they made their lives bitter with bondage, in morter and in brick, and in all manner
of service in the field; and all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor.
Though it is true, there ought not to be any comparison made betwixt the <i>Israelites</i> and
the <i>Indians</i>, those being Gods people, these not as yet; neverthelesse the comparison may
well hold in the oppression of the one and the other, and in the manner and cause of the
oppression, that being with bitternesse, rigour, and hard bondage, and lest they should
multiply and increase too much. Certain it is, these <i>Indians</i> suffer great oppression from
the <i>Spaniards</i>, live in great bitternesse, are under hard bondage, and serve with great rigor;
and al this, because they are at least a thousand of them for one <i>Spaniard</i>, they daily
multiply and increase, in children and wealth, and therefore are feared lest they should be
too mighty, and either rise up of themselves, or joyn themselves to any enemy against
their oppressors; for both which fears and jealousies, they are not allowed the use of any
weapons or armes, no not their bows and arrows, which their ancestors formerly used;
so that as hereby the <i>Spaniards</i> are secured from any hurt or annoyance from them as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
unarmed people; so may any other nation, that shall be incouraged to invade that land,
be secure also from the <i>Indians</i>, &amp; consequently the <i>Spaniards</i> own policy for themselves
against the <i>Indians</i> may be their greatest ruine, and destruction, being a great people and
yet no people; for the abundance of their <i>Indians</i> would be to them as no people; and
they themselves, (who out of their few Towns and Cities live but here and there, too
thinly scattered upon so great and capacious a land) would be but a handfull for any
reasonable Army; and of that handfull very few would be found able or fitting men;
and those able men would do little without the help of guns and ordnance; and if their
own oppressed people, <i>Black-mores</i> and <i>Indians</i> (which themselves have alwaies feared)
should side against them, soon would they be swallowed up both from within and from
without. And by this it may easily appear how ungrounded they are, who say, it is harder
to conquer <i>America</i> now then in <i>Cortez</i> his time, for that there are now both <i>Spaniards</i>
and <i>Indians</i> to fight against, and then there were none but bare and naked <i>Indians</i>.
This I say is a false ground; for then there were <i>Indians</i> trained up in wars one against
another, who knew wel to use their bows and arrows, and darts, and other weapons,
and were desperate in their fights and single combats, as may appear out of the histories
of them; but now they are cowardized, oppressed, unarmed, soon frighted with the
noise of a musket, nay with a sowre and grim look of a <i>Spaniard</i>, so from them there is
no fear; neither can there be from the <i>Spaniards</i>, who from all the vast dominions of <i>Guatemala</i>
are not able to raise five thousand able fighting men, nor to defend so many passages
as lie open in severall parts of that Country, which the wider and greater it
is, might be advantagious to an enemy, and while the <i>Spaniard</i> in one place might
oppose his strength, in many other places might his land be over-run by a foraine
nation; nay by their owne slaves the <i>Black-mores</i>, who doubtlesse to be set at liberty
would side against them in any such occasion; and lastly, the Criolians who also are
sore oppressed by them, would rejoyce in such a day, and yeeld rather to live with freedome
and liberty under a forain people, then to be longer oppressed by those of their
own blood.</p>

<p>The miserable condition of the <i>Indians</i> of that Country is such, that though the
Kings of <i>Spain</i> have never yeelded to what some would have, that they should be
slaves, yet their lives are as full of bitternesse as is the life of a slave. For which I have
known my selfe some of them that have come home from toyling and moyling with
<i>Spaniards</i>, after many blowes, some wounds, and little or no wages, who have sullenly
and stubbornly lain down upon their beds, resolving to die rather then to live
any longer a life so slavish, and have refused to take either meat or drinke, or any thing
else comfortable and nourishing, which their wives have offered unto them, that so
by pining and starving they might consume themselves. Some I have by good perswasions
encouraged to life rather then to a voluntary and wilfull death; others there
have been that would not be perswaded, but in that wilfull way have died. The <i>Spaniards</i>
that live about that Country (especially the farmers of the valley of <i>Mixco, Pinola,
Petapa, Amatitlan</i>, and those of the <i>Sacatepeques</i>) alleadge that all their trading,
and farming, is for the good of the Common-wealth, and therefore whereas there
are not <i>Spaniards</i> enough for so ample and large a Countrey to doe all their work, and
all are not able to buy slaves and <i>Blackmores</i>, they stand in need of the <i>Indians</i> help
to serve them for their pay and hire; whereupon it hath been considered, that a partition
of <i>Indian</i> labourers be made every Monday, or Sonday in the afternoon to the
<i>Spaniards</i>, according to the farmes they occupie, or acording to their severall employments,
calling, and trading with Mules, or any other way. So that for such and such a
district there is named an officer, who is called Juez Repartidor, who according to a
List made of every farme, house, and person, is to give so many <i>Indians</i> by the week.
And here is a doore opened to the president of <i>Guatemala</i>, and to the Judges to provide
well for their meniall servants, whom they commonly appoint for this office, which
is thus performed by them. They name the Town and place of their meeting upon
Sonday or Monday, to the which themselves and the <i>Spaniards</i> of that district do resort.
The <i>Indians</i> of the severall Towns are to have in a readinesse so many labourers
as the Court of <i>Guatemala</i> hath appointed to be weekly taken out of such a Towne,
who are conducted by an <i>Indian</i> officer to the Towne of generall meeting; and when
they come thither with their tooles, their spades, shovels, bils, or axes, with their
provision of victuals for a week (which are commonly some dry cakes of Maiz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
puddings of frixoles, or <i>French</i> beanes, and a little Chile or biting long pepper, or a
bit of cold meat for the first day or two) and with beds on their backes (which is
only a course woollen mantle to wrap about them when they lye on the bare ground)
then are they shut up in the Towne-house, some with blowes, some with spurnings,
some with boxes on the eare, if presently they goe not in. Now all being gathered
together, and the house filled with them, the Juez Repartidor or officer, calls by the
order of the List such and such a <i>Spaniard</i>, and also calls out of the house so many
<i>Indians</i> as by the Court are commanded to be given him (some are allowed three, some
foure, some ten, some fifteen, some twenty, according to their employments)
and delivereth unto the <i>Spaniard</i> his <i>Indians</i>, and so to all the rest, till they be all served;
who when they receive their <i>Indians</i>, take from them a toole, or their mantles;
to secure them that they run not away; and for every <i>Indian</i> delivered unto them,
they give unto the Juez Repartidor or officer, halfe a Riall, which is three pence an
<i>Indian</i> for his fees, which mounteth yeerly to him to a great deale of money; for some
officers make a partition or distribution of four hundred, some of two hundred, some
of three hundred <i>Indians</i>, every week, and carrieth home with him so many halfe hundred
Rials for one, or halfe a daies worke. If complaint be made by any <i>Spaniard</i>
that such and such an <i>Indian</i> did run away from him, and served him not the week past,
the <i>Indian</i> must be brought, and surely tied to a post by his hands in the Market place,
and there be whipped upon his bare backe. But if the poor <i>Indian</i> complaine that the
<i>Spaniards</i> cousened and cheated him of his shovell, axe, bill, mantle, or wages, no
justice shall be executed against the cheating <i>Spaniard</i>, neither shall the <i>Indian</i> be righted,
though it is true the order runs equally in favour of both <i>Indian</i> and <i>Spaniard</i>. Thus
are the poore <i>Indians</i> sold for three pence a peece for a whole weeks slavery, not permitted
to goe home at nights unto their wives, though their worke lie not above a mile
from the Town where they live; nay some are carried ten or twelve miles from their
home, who must not returne till Saturday night late, and must that week do whatsoever
their Master pleaseth to command them. The wages appointed them will scarce
find them meat and drinke, for they are not allowed a Riall a day, which is but sixpence,
and with that they are to find themselves, but for six daies worke and diet they
are to have five Rials, which is halfe a crowne. This same order is observed in the
City of <i>Guatemala</i>, and Townes of <i>Spaniards</i>, where to every family that wants the
service of an <i>Indian</i> or <i>Indians</i>, though it be but to fetch water and wood on their backs,
or to goe of arrants, is allowed the like service from the neerest <i>Indian</i> Townes. It
would grieve a Christians heart to see how by some cruell <i>Spaniards</i> in that weeks service,
those poor wretches are wronged and abused; some visiting their wives at home,
whilst their poore husbands are digging and delving; others whipping them for their
slow working, others wounding them with their swords, or breaking their heads for
some reasonable and well grounded answer in their own behalfe, others stealing from
them their tooles, others cheating them of halfe, others of all their wages, alleadging
that their service cost them halfe a Riall, and yet their worke not well performed.
I knew some who made a common practice of this, when their wheat was sowne, and
they had little to do for the <i>Indians</i>; yet they would have home as many as were due
unto their farme, and on Monday and Tuesday would make them cut and bring them
on their backes as much wood as they needed all that week, and then on Wednesday
at noon (knowing the great desire of the <i>Indians</i> to goe home to their wives, for the
which they would give any thing) would say unto them, What will you give me now,
if I let you goe home to doe your own worke? whereunto the <i>Indians</i> would joyfully
reply and answer, some that they would give a Riall, others two Rials, which
they would take and send them home, and so would have much worke done, wood to
serve their house a week, and mony as much as would buy them meat, and Cacao for
Chocolatte two weeks together; and thus from the poor <i>Indians</i> doe those unconscionable
<i>Spaniards</i> practice a cheap and lazy way of living. Others will sell them
away for that week unto a neighbour that hath present need of worke, demanding
Rials a piece for every <i>Indian</i>, which he that buyeth them, will be sure to defray out
of their wages. So likewise are they in a slavish bondage and readinesse for all passengers
and travellers, who in any Towne may demand unto the next Towne as many
<i>Indians</i> do goe with his Mules, or to carry on their backes a heavy burthen as he shall
need, who at the journeys end will pick some quarrell with them, and so send them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
back with blowes and stripes without any pay at all. A Petaca, or leatherne Trunke,
and chest of above a hundred weight, they will make those wretches to carry on their
backs a whole day, nay some two or three daies together, which they doe by tying the
chest on each side with ropes, having a broad leather in the middle, which they crosse
over the forepart of their head, or over their forehead, hanging thus the waight upon
their heads and browes, which at their journeys end hath made the blood stick in the
foreheads of some, galling and pulling off the skin, and marking them in the fore-top
of their heads, who as they are called <i>Tamemez</i>, so are easily known in a Towne by
their baldnesse, that leather girt having worn off all their hair. With these hard usages,
yet do those poor people make a shift to live amongst the <i>Spaniards</i>, but so that
with anguish of heart they are still crying out to God for justice, and for liberty, whose
only comfort is in their Preists and Friers, who many times doe quiet them when they
would rise up in mutiny, and for their owne ends doe often prevaile over them with
fair and cunning perswasions, to bear and suffer for Gods sake, and for the good of the
Common-wealth that hard task and service which is laid upon them. And though in
all seasons, wet and dry, cold and hot, and in all wayes plain and mountainous, green
and dirty, dusty and stony, they must performe this hard service to their commanding
Masters, their apparell and cloathing is but such as may cover the nakednesse of their
body, nay in some it is such torne rags as will not cover halfe their nakednesse. Their
ordinary cloathing is a paire of linnen or woollen drawers broad and open at the
knees, without shooes (though in their journeys some will put on leatherne sandals
to keep the soles of their feet) or stockins, without any doublet, a short course shirt,
which reacheth a little below their waste, and serves more for a doublet then for a shirt,
and for a cloake a woollen or linnen mantle, (called Aiate) tied with a knot over
one shoulder, hanging down on the other side almost to the ground, with a twelve penny
or two shilling hat, which after one good shower of raine like paper falls about their
necks and eies; their bed they carry sometimes about them, which is that woollen
mantle wherewith they wrap themselves about at night, taking off their shirt and
drawers, which they lay under their head for a pillow; some will carry with them a
short, slight, and light Mat to lie, but those that carry it not with them, if they cannot
borrow one of a neighbour, lie as willingly in their mantle upon the bare ground,
as a Gentleman in <i>England</i> upon a soft down-bed, and thus doe they soundly sleep,
and lowdly snort after a daies worke, or after a daies journey with a hundred weight
upon their backs. Those that are of the better sort, and richer, and who are not
employed as <i>Tamemez</i> to carry burthens, or as Labourers to work for <i>Spaniards</i>, but
keep at home following their own farmes, or following their owne Mules about the
Country, or following their trades and callings in their shops, or governing the
Townes, as Alcaldes, or Alguaziles, officers of justice, may goe a little better apparelled,
but after the same manner. For some will have their drawers with a lace at the
bottom, or wrought with some coloured Silke or Crewel; so likewise the mantle about
them, shall have either a lace, or some work of birds on it, some will wear a
cut linnen doublet, others shooes, but very few stockins or bands about their neckes;
and for their beds, the best <i>Indian</i> Governour, or the richest, who may be worth four
or five thousand Duckats, will have little more then the poor <i>Tamemez</i>; for they lie
upon boards, or Canes bound together, and raised from the ground, whereon they
lay a broad and handsome Mat, and at their heads for man and wife two little stumps
of wood for bolsters, whereon they lay their shirts and mantles and other cloaths for
pillowes, covering themselves with a broader blanket then is their mantle, and thus
hardly would <i>Don Bernabe de Guzman</i> the Governour of <i>Petapa</i> lie, and so doe all
the best of them. The womens attire is cheap and soon put on; for most of them
also go barefoot, the richer and better sort wear shooes, with broad ribbons for shooe-strings,
and for a petticote, they tie about their waste a woollen mantle, which in
the better sort is wrought with divers colours, but not sowed at all, pleated or gathered
in, but as they tie it with a list about them; they wear no shift next their body, but cover
their nakednesse with a kind of surplice (which they call <i>Guaipil</i>) which hangs loose
from their shoulders down a little below their waste, with open short sleeves, which
cover halfe their armes; this Guaipil is curiously wrought, especially in the bosome,
with Cotton, or feathers. The richer sort of them wear bracelets and bobs about
their wrists and necks; their hair is gathered up with fillets, without any quaife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
or covering, except it be the better sort. When they goe to Church or abroad, they
put upon their heads a vaile of linnen, which hangeth almost to the ground, and this
is that which costs them most of all their attire, for that commonly it is of <i>Holland</i> or
some good linnen brought from <i>Spain</i>, or fine linnen brought from <i>China</i>, which the
better sort wear with a lace about. When they are at home at work they commonly
take off their Guaipil, or surplice, discovering the nakednesse of their breasts and body.
They lie also in their beds as doe their husbands, wrapped up only with a mantle,
or with a blanket. Their houses are but poore thatched cottages, without any upper
roomes, but commonly one or two only roomes below, in the one they dresse their
meat in the middle of it, making a compasse for fire, with two or three stones, without
any other chimney to convey the smoak away, which spreading it selfe about the
roome filleth the thatch and the rafters so with sut, that all the roome seemeth to be
a chimney. The next unto it, is not free from smoak and blacknesse, where sometimes
are four or five beds according to the family. The poorer sort have but one room,
where they eat, dresse their meat, and sleep. Few there are that set any lockes upon
their dores, for they fear no robbing nor stealing, neither have they in their houses
much to lose, earthen pots, and pans, and dishes, and cups to drinke their Chocolatte,
being the chief commodities in their house. There is scarce any house which
hath not also in the yard a stew, wherein they bath themselves with hot water, which
is their chief physick when they feel themselves distempered. Among themselves they
are in every Town divided into Tribes, which have one chief head, to whom all that
belong unto that Tribe, doe resort in any difficult matters, who is bound to aid, protect,
defend, counsell, and appear for the rest of his Tribe before the officers of justice
in any wrong that is like to be done unto them. When any is to be married, the father
of the son that is to take a wife out of another Tribe, goeth unto the head of his
Tribe to give him warning of his sons marriage with such a maid. Then that head
meets with the head of the maids Tribe, and they conferre about it. The businesse
commonly is in debate a quarter of a yeer; all which time the parents of the youth or
man are with gifts to buy the maid; they are to be at the charges of all that is spent in
eating and drinking, when the heads of the two Tribes doe meet with the rest of the
kindred of each side, who sometimes sit in conference a whole day, or most part of
a night. After many dayes and nights thus spent, and a full triall being made of the
one and other sides affection, if they chance to disagree about the marriage, then is
the Tribe and parents of the maid to restore back all that the other side hath spent and
given. They give no portions with their daughters, but when they die, their goods
and lands are equally divided among their sons. If any one want a house to live in,
or will repair and thatch his house anew, notice is given to the heads of the Tribes,
who warn all the Town to come to help in the work, and every one is to bring a bundle
of straw, and other materials, so that in one day with the helpe of many they finish a
house, without any charges more then of Chocolatte, which they minister in great cups
as big as will hold above a pint, not putting in any costly materials, as doe the <i>Spaniards</i>,
but only a little Anniseed, and Chile, or <i>Indian</i> pepper; or else they halfe fill the cup
with Attolle, and powre upon it as much Chocolatte as will fill the cup and colour it.
In their diet the poorer sort are limited many times to a dish of Frixoles, or Turkey
beanes, either black or white (which are there in very great abundance, and are kept
dry for all the yeer) boyled with Chile; and if they can have this, they hold themselves
well satisfied; with these beanes, they make also dumplins, first boyling the bean
a little, and then mingling it with a masse of Maiz, as we do mingle Currants in our
cakes, and so boile again the frixoles with the dumplin of Maiz masse, and so eat it hot,
or keep it cold; but this and all whatsoever else they eat, they either eat it with green
biting Chile, or else they dip it in water and salt, wherein is bruised some of that
Chile. But if their means will not reach to frixoles, their ordinary fare and diet is,
their Tortilla's (so they call thin round cakes made of the dow and Masse of Maiz)
which they eat hot from an earthen pan, whereon they are soon baked with one turning
over the fire; and these they eat alone either with Chile and salt, and dipping
them in water and salt with a little bruised Chile. When their Maiz is green and tender,
they boil some of those whole stalkes or clusters, whereon the Maiz groweth with
the leaf about, and so casting a little salt about it, they eat it. I have often eate of
this, and found it as dainty as our young green pease, and very nourishing, but it much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
increaseth the blood. Also of this green and tender Maiz they make a Furmity, boiling
the Maiz in some of the milke which they have first taken out of it by bruising it. The
poorest <i>Indian</i> never wants this diet, and is well satisfied, as long as his belly is thorowly
filled. But the poorest that live in such Townes where flesh meat is sold, will
make a hard shift, but that when they come from worke on Saturday night, they will
buy one halfe Riall, or a Riall worth of fresh meat to eat on the Lords day. Some will
buy a good deal at once, and keep it long by dressing it into Tassajo's, which are bundles
of flesh, rowled up and tied fast; which they doe, when for examples sake they
have from a leg of beefe sliced off from the bone all the flesh with the knife, after the
length, forme, and thinnesse of a line, or rope. Then they take the flesh and salt it,
(which being sliced and thinly cut, soon takes salt) and hang it up in their yards like
a line from post to post, or from tree to tree, to the wind for a whole week, and then
they hang it in the smoak another week, and after rowle it up in small bundles, which
become as hard as a stone, and so as they need it, they wash it, boyl it and eat it. This
is <i>America's</i> powdered beef, which they call Tassajo, whereof I have often eaten, and
the <i>Spaniards</i> eat much of it, especially those that trade about the Countrey with
Mules; nay this Tassajo is a great commodity, and hath made many a <i>Spaniard</i> rich,
who carry a Mule or two loaden with these Tassajo's in small parcels and bundles to
those Townes where is no flesh at all sold, and there they exchange them for other
commodities among the <i>Indians</i>, receiving peradventure for one Tassajo or bundle,
(which cost them but the halfe part of a farthing) as much Cacao, as in other places
they sell for a Riall or sixpence. The richer sort of people will fare better, for if
there be fish or flesh to bee had, they will have it, and eat most greedily of it; and will
not spare their fowls and Turkeys from their own bellies. These also will now and then
get a wild Dear, shooting it with their bows and arrows. And when they have killed it,
they let it lie in the wood in some hole or bottom covered with leaves for the space of
about a week, untill it stinke and begin to be full of wormes; then they bring it home,
cut it out into joynts, and parboil it with an herbe which groweth there somewhat
like unto our Tanzy, which they say sweetneth it again, and maketh the flesh eat tender,
and as white as a peice of Turkey. Thus parboiled, they hang up the joynts in
the smoke for a while, and then boyle it again, when they eat it, which is commonly
dressed with red <i>Indian</i> pepper; and this is the Venison of <i>America</i>, whereof I have
sometimes eaten, and found it white and short, but never durst be too bold with it,
not that I found any evill taste in it, but that the apprehension of the wormes and
maggots which formerly had been in it, troubled much my stomack. These <i>Indians</i>
that have little to doe at home, and are not employed in the weekly service under the <i>Spaniards</i>
in their hunting, will looke seriously for Hedge-hogs, which are just like unto
ours, though certainly ours are not meat for any Christian. They are full of pricks
and brisles like ours, and are found in woods and fields, living in holes, and as they
say feed upon nothing but Amits and their egs, and upon dry rotten sticks, herbes,
and roots; of these they eat much, the flesh being as white and sweet as a Rabbit, and
as fat as is a <i>January</i> hen kept up and fatted in a Coope. Of this meat I have also eaten,
and confesse it is a dainty dish there, though I will not say the same of a Hedge-hog
here; for what here may be poyson, there may be good and lawfull meate, by
some accidentall difference in the creature it selfe, and in that which it feeds upon, or in
the temper of the air and climate. This meat not only the <i>Indians</i> but the best of the
<i>Spaniards</i> feed on it; and it is so much esteemed of, that because in Lent they are commonly
found, the <i>Spaniards</i> will not be deprived of it, but do eat it also then, alleadging
that it is no flesh (though in the eating it be in fatnesse and in taste, and in all like
unto flesh) for that it feeds not upon any thing that is very nourishing, but chiefly
upon Amits egs, and dry sticks. It is a great point of controversie amongst their
Divines, some hold it lawfull, others unlawfull for that time; it seems the pricks and
brisles of the <i>Indian</i> Hedge-hog prick their consciences with a foolish scruple. Another
kind of meat they feed much on which is called <i>Iguana</i>; of these some are found in
the waters, others upon the land. They are longer then a Rabbit, and like unto a Scorpion,
with some green, some black scales on their backes. Those upon the land will
run very fast, like Lizards, and will climbe up trees like Squerrils, and breed in the
roots of trees or in stone walls. The sight of them is enough to affright one; and
yet when they are dressed and stewed in broth with a little spice, they make a dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
broth, and eat also as white as a Rabbit, nay the middle bone is made just like
the backe bone of a Rabbit. They are dangerous meat, if not throughly
boiled, and they had almost cost mee my life for eating too much of them, not being
stewed enough. There are also many water and land Tortoi's, which the <i>Indians</i> find
out for themselves, and also relish exceeding well unto the <i>Spaniards</i> palate. As for
drinking, the <i>Indians</i> generally are much given unto it; and drinke if they have nothing
else, of their poore and simple Chocolatte, without Sugar or many compounds,
or of Atolle, untill their bellies bee ready to burst. But if they can get any drink that
will make them mad drunk, they will not give it over as long as a drop is left, or a
penny remaines in their purse to purchase it. Among themselves they use to make such
drinks as are in operation far stronger then wine, and these they confection in such great
Jarres as come from <i>Spain</i>; wherein they put some little quantity of water, and fill
up the Jar with some Melasso's, or juyce of the Sugar Cane, or some hony for to sweeten
it; then for the strengthning of it, they put roots and leaves of Tobacco, with other
kinde of roots which grow there, and they know to bee strong in operation, nay
in some places I have known where they have put in a live Toad, and so closed up the
Jarre for a fortnight, or moneths space, till all that they have put in him, be throughly
steeped and the toad consumed, and the drink well strengthned, then they open it, and
call their friends to the drinking of it, (which commonly they doe in the night time,
lest their Preist in the Towne should have notice of them in the day) which they never
leave off, untill they bee mad, and raging drunke. This drink they call Chicha, which
stinketh most filthily, and certainly is the cause of many <i>Indians</i> death, especially where
they use the toads poyson with it. Once I was informed living in <i>Mixco</i>, of a great meeting
that was appointed in an <i>Indians</i> house; and I took with mee the Officers of Justice
of the Town, to search that <i>Indians</i> house, where I found foure Jarres of <i>Chicha</i> not
yet opened, I caused them to be taken out, and broken in the street before his doore,
and the filthy Chicha to be poured out, which left such a stinking sent in my nostrils,
that with the smell of it, or apprehension of its loathsomenesse, I fell to vomiting, and
continued sick almost a whole week after.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Spaniards</i> knowing this inclination of the <i>Indians</i> unto drunkennesse, doe
herein much abuse and wrong them; though true it is, there is a strict order, even to
the forfeiting of the wine of anyone who shall presume to sell wine in a Towne of
<i>Indians</i>, with a mony mulct besides. Yet for all this the baser and poorer sort of
<i>Spaniards</i> for their lucre and gaine contemning authority, will goe out from <i>Guatemala</i>,
to the Towns of <i>Indians</i> about, and carry such wine to sell and inebriate the
Natives as may bee very advantagious to themselves; for of one Jarre of wine, they
will make two at least, confectioning it with hony and water, and other strong drugs
which are cheap to them, and strongly operative upon the poore and weak <i>Indians</i>
heads, and this they will sell for currant <i>Spanish</i> wine, with such pint and quart measures,
as never were allowed by Justice Order, but by themselves invented. With such
wine they soone intoxicate the poore <i>Indians</i>, and when they have made them drunk,
then they will cheat them more, making them pay double for their quart measure; and
when they see they can drinke no more, then they will cause them to ly down and sleep,
and in the meane while will pick their pockets. This is a common sinne among those
<i>Spaniards</i> of <i>Guatemala</i>, and much practised in the City upon the <i>Indians</i>, when they
come thither to buy or sell. Those that keep the Bodegones (so are called the houses
that sell wine, which are no better then a Chandlers shop, for besides wine they sell
Candles, Fish, Salt, Cheese and Bacon) will commonly intice in the <i>Indians</i>, and make
them drunk, and then pick their pockets, and turne them out of doores with blowes
and stripes, if they will not fairly depart. There was in <i>Guatemala</i> in my time one of
these Bodegoners, or shopkeeper of wine and small ware, named <i>Joan Ramos</i>, who
by thus cheating and tipling poore <i>Indians</i> (as it was generally reported) was worth
two hundred thousand duckates, and in my time gave with a daughter that was married,
eight thousand Duckats. No <i>Indian</i> should passe by his doore, but he would call
him in, and play upon him as aforesaid. In my time a <i>Spanish</i> Farmer, neighbour of
mine in the Valley of <i>Mixco</i>, chanced to send to <i>Guatemala</i> his <i>Indian</i> servants with
half a dozen mules loaden with wheat to a Merchant, with whom hee had agreed before
for the price, and ordered the money to bee sent unto him by his servant (whom
hee had kept six yeers, and ever found him trusty) the wheat being delivered, and the
money received (the which mounted to ten pound, sixteen shillings, every mule carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
six bushels, at twelve Rials a bushel, as was then the price) the <i>Indian</i> with another
Mate of his walking along the streets to buy some small commodities, passed by
<i>John Ramos</i> his shop, or Bodegon, who enticing him and his Mate in, soone tripped up
their heals with a little confectioned wine for that purpose, and tooke away all his
mony from the intruded <i>Indian</i>, and beat them out of his house; who thus drunk being
forced to ride home, the <i>Indian</i> that had received the money, fell from his mule, and
broke his neck; the other got home without his Mate, or money. The Farmer prosecuted
<i>John Ramos</i> in the Court for his money, but <i>Ramos</i> being rich and abler to bribe,
then the Farmer, got off very well, and so had done formerly in almost the like cases.
These are but peccadillo's among those <i>Spaniards</i>, to make drunke, rob, and occasion
the poor <i>Indians</i> death; whose death with them is no more regarded nor vindicated,
then the death of a sheep or bullock, that falls into a pit. And thus having spoken of
apparrell, houses, eating and drinking, it remaines that I say somewhat of their civility,
and Religion of those who lived under the Government of the <i>Spaniards</i>. From the
<i>Spaniards</i> they have borrowed their Civill Government, and in all Townes they have
one, or two <i>Alcaldes</i>, with more or lesse <i>Regidores</i>, (who are as Aldermen or Jurates amongst
us) and some <i>Alguaziles</i>, more or lesse, who are as Constables, to execute the orders
of the <i>Alcalde</i>, (who is a Maior) with his Brethren. In Towns of three or four hundred
Families, or upwards, there are commonly two Alcaldes, six Regidores, two Alguaziles
Maiors, and six under, or petty Alguaziles. And some Towns are priviledged with
an <i>Indian</i> Governour, who is above the Alcaldes, and all the rest of the Officers. These
are changed every yeer by new election, and are chosen by the <i>Indians</i> themselves, who
take their turnes by the tribes or kindreds, whereby they are divided. Their offices
begin on New-Yeers day, and after that day their election is carryed to the City of
<i>Guatemala</i> (if in that district it bee made) or else to the heads of Justice, or <i>Spanish</i>
Governours of the severall Provinces, who confirm the new Election, and take account
of the last yeers expences made by the other Officers, who carry with them their Town-Book
of accounts; and therefore for this purpose every Town hath a Clerk, or Scrivener,
called Escrivano, who commonly continueth many yeers in his office, by reason
of the paucity and unfitnesse of <i>Indian</i> Scriveners, who are able to bears such a charge.
This Clerk hath many fees for his writings and informations, and accounts, as have
the <i>Spaniards</i>, though not so much money or bribes, but a small matter, according
to the poverty of the <i>Indians</i>. The Governour is also commonly continued many
yeers, being some chief man among the <i>Indians</i>, except for his misdemeanours hee
bee complained of, or the <i>Indians</i> in generall doe all stomack him.</p>

<p>Thus they being setled in a civill way of government, they may execute justice upon
all such <i>Indians</i> of their Town as doe notoriously and scandalously offend. They
may imprison, fine, whip, and banish, but hang and quarter they may not; but must remit
such cases to the <i>Spanish</i> Governour. So likewise if a <i>Spaniard</i> passing by the
Town, or living in it, doe trouble the peace, and misdemean himself, they may lay
hold on him, and send him to the next <i>Spanish</i> Justice, with a full information of his
offence, but fine him, or keep him about one night in Prison they may not. This order
they have against <i>Spaniards</i>, but they dare not execute it, for a whole Town standeth in
awe of one <i>Spaniard</i>, and though hee never so hainously offend, and bee unruly, with
oathes, threatnings, and drawing of his sword, hee maketh them quake and tremble,
and not presume to touch him; for they know if they doe, they shall have the worst,
either by blowes, or by some mis-information, which hee will give against them. And
this hath been very often tried, for where <i>Indians</i> have by virtue of their order indeavoured
to curbe an unruly <i>Spaniard</i> in their Town, some of them have been wounded,
others beaten, and when they have carried the <i>Spaniard</i> before a <i>Spanish</i> Justice
and Governour, hee hath pleaded for what hee hath done, saying it was in his
owne defence, or for his King and Sovereign, and that the <i>Indians</i> would have killed
him, and began to mutiny all together against the <i>Spanish</i> Authority, and Government,
denying to serve him with what hee needed for his way and journey; that they would
not bee slaves to give him or any <i>Spaniard</i> any attendance; and that they would
make an end of him, and of all the <i>Spaniards</i>. With these and such like false and lying
mis-informations, the unruly <i>Spaniards</i> have often been beleeved, and too much upheld
in their rude and uncivill misdemeanors, and the <i>Indians</i> bitterly curbed, and
punished, and answer made them in such cases, that if they had been killed for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
mutiny and rebellion against the King, and his best subjects they had beene served well
enough; and that if they gave not attendance unto the <i>Spaniard</i>, that passed by their
Town, their houses should bee fired, and they and their children utterly consumed.
With such like answers from the Justices, and credency to what any base <i>Spaniard</i> shall
inform against them, the poore <i>Indians</i> are fain to put up all wrongs done unto them,
not daring to meddle with any <i>Spaniard</i>, bee hee never so unruly, by virtue of that
Order, which they have against them. Amongst themselves, if any complaint be made
against any <i>Indian</i>, they dare not meddle with him untill they call all his kindred, and
especially the head of that Tribe, to which hee belongeth; who if hee and the rest
together, find him to deserve imprisonment, or whipping, or any other punishment,
then the Officers of Justice, the Alcaldes or Maiors, and their Brethren the Jurates inflict
upon him that punishment; which all shall agree upon. But yet after judgment
and sentence given, they have another, which is their last appeale, if they please,
and that is to their Priest, and Fryer, who liveth in their Town, by whom they will
sometimes bee judged, and undergoe what punishment hee shall think fittest. To the
Church therefore they often resort in points of Justice, thinking the Preist knoweth
more of Law and equity, then themselves; who sometimes reverseth what judgement
hath been given in the Town house, blaming the Officers for their partiality and passion
against their poore Brother, and setting free the party judged by them; which the
Preist does oftentimes, if such an <i>Indian</i> doe belong to the Church, or to the service
of their house, or have any other relation to them, peradventure for their wives sake,
whom either they affect, or imploy in washing, or making their Chocolatte. Such,
and their husbands may live lawlesse as long as the Preist is in the Town. And if
when the Preist is absent, they call them to triall for any misdemeanor, and whip, fine,
or imprison, (which occasion they will sometimes pick out on purpose) when the
Preist returnes, they shall bee sure to heare of it, and smart for it, yea, and the Officers
themselves peradventure bee whipped in the Church, by the Preists order and appointment;
against whom they dare not speake, but willingly accept what stripes and punishment
hee layeth upon them, judging his wisdome, sentence, and punishing hand,
the wisdome, sentence and hand of God; whom as they have been taught to be over
all Princes, Judges, worldly Officers, so likewise they beleeve, (and have been so taught)
that his Preists and Ministers are above theirs, and all worldly power and authority.
It happened unto mee living in the Town of <i>Mixco</i>, that an <i>Indian</i> being judged to
bee whipped for some disorders, which hee committed, would not yeeld to the sentence,
but apealed to mee, saying hee would have his stripes in the Church, and by my order,
for so hee said his whipping would doe him good, as comming from the hand of
God. When hee was brought unto mee, I could not reverse the <i>Indians</i> judgment, for
it was just, and so caused him to be whipped, which hee tooke very patiently and merrily,
and after kissed my hands and gave mee an offering of mony for the good hee
said, I had done unto his soule. Besides this civility of justice amongst them, they live
as in other Civill and Politick and well governed Common-wealths; for in most of
their Townes, there are some that professe such trades as are practised among <i>Spaniards</i>.
There are amongst them Smiths, Taylors, Carpenters, Masons, Shoomakers, and the
like. It was my fortune to set upon a hard and difficult building in a Church of
<i>Mixco</i>, where I desired to make a very broad and capacious vault over the Chappell,
which was the harder to bee finished in a round circumference, because it depended upon
a triangle, yet for this work I sought none but <i>Indians</i>, some of the Town, some
from other places, who made it so compleat, that the best &amp; skilfullest workmen among
the <i>Spaniards</i> had enough to wonder at it. So are most of their Churches vaulted
on the top, and all by <i>Indians</i>; they onely in my time built a new Cloister in the Town
of <i>Amatitlan</i>, which they finished with many Arches of stone both in the lower walks
and in the upper galleries, with as much perfection as the best Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>,
had before beene built by the <i>Spaniard</i>. Were they more incouraged by the <i>Spaniards</i>,
and taught better principles both for soule and body, doubtlesse they would among
themselves make a very good Common-wealth. For painting they are much inclined
to it, and most of the pictures, and Altars of the Country Townes are their workmanship.
In most of their Townes they have a Schoole, where they are taught to read,
to sing, and some to write. To the Church there doe belong according as the Town is
in bignesse, so many Singers, and Trumpeters, and Waits, over whom the Preist hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
one Officer, who is called <i>Fiscal</i>; he goeth with a white Staffe with a little Silver Crosse on
the top to represent the Church, and shew that he is the Preists Clerk and Officer. When
any case is brought to be examined by the Preist, this Fiscall or Clerk executeth Justice
by the Preists Order. He must be one that can read &amp; write, and is commonly the Master
of Musick. He is bound upon the Lords Day and other Saints dayes, to gather to the
Church before and after Service all the yong youths, and maids, and to teach them the
Prayers, Sacraments, Commandements, and other points of Catechisme allowed by
the Church of Rome. In the morning hee and the other Musicians at the sound of the
Bell, are bound to come to Church to sing and officiate at Masse, which in many
Townes they performe with Organs and other musicall Instruments, (as hath beene
observed before) as well as <i>Spaniards</i>. So likewise at Evening at five of the clock they
are again to resort to the Church, when the Bell calleth, to sing Prayers, which they
call Completa's, or Completory, with <i>Salve Regina</i>, a prayer to the Virgin Mary. This
Fiscal is a great man in the Town, and beares more sway then the Majors, Jurates, and
other Officers of Justice, and when the Preist is pleased, giveth attendance to him,
goeth about his arrants, appointeth such as are to wait on him, when hee rideth out
of Town. Both hee and all that doth belong unto the Church, are exempted from
the common weekely service of the <i>Spaniards</i>, and from giving attendance to Travellers,
and from other Officers of Justice. But they are to attend with their Waits,
Trumpets, and Musick, upon any great man or Preist that cometh to their Town, and to
make Arches with boughes and flowers in the streets for their entertainment. Besides
these, those also that doe belong unto the service of the Preists house, are priviledged
from the <i>Spaniards</i> service. Now the Preist hath change of servants by the week, who
take their turnes so, that they may have a weeke or two to spare to doe their work. If
it bee a great Town, hee hath three Cookes allowed him, (if a small Town, but two)
men Cookes who change their turnes, except hee have any occasion of feasting, then
they all come. So likewise hee hath two or three more (whom they call Chahal) as
Butlers, who keepe whatsoever Provision is in the house under lock and Key; and give
to the Cooke what the Preist appointeth to bee dressed for his dinner, or supper; these
keep the Table Clothes, Napkins, Dishes, and Trenchers, and lay the Cloth, and take away,
and wait at the Table; hee hath besides three or foure, and in great Towns half
a dozen of boyes to doe his arrants, wait at the Table, and sleep in the house all the
week by their turnes, who with the Cookes and Butlers dine and sup constantly in the
Preists house, and at his charges. Hee hath also at dinner and supper times the attendance
of some old women (who also take their turnes) to oversee half a dozen yong
maids, who next to the Priests house doe meet to make him, and his family Tortilla's
or Cakes of Maiz, which the boyes doe bring hot to the Table by halfe a dozen at
a time. Besides these servants, if hee have a Garden hee is allowed two or three gardeners;
and for his stable, at least half a dozen <i>Indians</i>, who morning and evening
are to bring him Sacate (as there they call it) or herb and grasse for his Mules or Horses,
these diet not in the house; but the groome of the stable, who is to come at morning,
noone, and Evening, (and therefore are three or foure to change) or at any time that
the Preist will ride out; these I say and the Gardners (when they are at work) dine
and sup at the Priests charges; who sometimes in great Townes hath above a dozen
to feed and provide for. There are besides belonging to the Church priviledged from
the weekly attendance upon the <i>Spaniards</i> two or three <i>Indians</i>, called Sacristanes, who
have care of the Vestry and Copes, and Altar Clothes, and every day make ready
the Altar or Altars for Masse; also to every Company or Sodality of the Saints, or
Virgin, there are two or three, whom they call Mayordomo's, who gather about the
Towne Almes for the maintaining of the Sodality; these also gather Egges about the
Town for the Preist every week, and give him an account of their gatherings, and allow
him every moneth, or fortnight, two Crownes for a Masse to bee sung to the
Saint.</p>

<p>If there be any fishing place neer the Town, then the Preist also is allowed for to
seek him fish three or foure, and in some places half a dozen <i>Indians</i>, besides the offerings
in the Church, and many other offerings which they bring whensoever they come to
speak unto the Preist, or to confesse with him, or for a Saints feast to bee celebrated,
and besides their Tithes of every thing, there is a monethly maintenance in money allowed
unto the Preist, and brought unto him by the Alcaldes, or Maiors, and Jurates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which he setteth his hand unto in a book of the Townes expences. This maintenance
(though it be allowed by the <i>Spanish</i> magistrate, and paid in the Kings name for the
preaching of the Gospel) yet it comes out of the poor <i>Indians</i> purses and labour, and
is either gathered about the Town, or taken out of the Tribute, which they pay unto
the King, or from a common plat of ground which with the help of all is sowed
and gathered in and sold for that purpose. All the Townes in <i>America</i>, which are
civilized and under the <i>Spanish</i> government, belong either to the Crowne, or to some
other Lords, whom they cal Encomendero's, and pay a yeerly tribute unto them. Those
that are tenants to their Lords or Encomendero's (who commonly are such as descend
from the first conquerors) pay yet unto the King some small tribute in mony, besides
what they pay in other kind of commodities unto their owne Encomendero, and in
mony also. There is no Town so poor, where every married <i>Indian</i> doth not pay at the
least in mony four Rials a yeer for tribute to the <i>King</i>, besides other four Rials to his
Lord, or Encomendero. And if the Town pay only to the King, they pay at least six, and
in some places eight Rials by statute, besides what other commodities are common to
the Town or Country where they live, as Maiz, (that is paid in all Townes) hony,
Turkeys, fowles, salt, Cacao, Mantles of Cotton-wool; and the like commodities
they pay who are subject to an Encomendero; but such pay only mony, not commodities
to the King. The Mantles of tribute are much esteemed of, for they are
choise ones, and of a bigger size, then others, so likewise is the tribute <i>Cacao, Achiotte,
Cochinil</i>, where it is paid; for the best is set apart for the tribute; and if the <i>Indians</i>
bring that which is not prime good, they shall surely be lashed, and sent backe for
better. The heads of the severall Tribes have care to gather it, and to deliver it to the
Alcaldes and Regidores, Maiors and Jurates, who carry it either to the Kings Exchequer
in the City, or to the neerest <i>Spanish</i> Justice (if it belong to the King) or to
the Lord, or Encomendero of the Towne. In nothing I ever perceived the <i>Spaniards</i>
mercifull and indulgent unto the <i>Indians</i>, but in this, that if an <i>Indian</i> bee very
weak, poore, and sickly and not able to work, or threescore and ten yeers of age,
he is freed from paying any tribute. There be also some Towns priviledged from
this tribute; which are those that can prove themselves to have descended from <i>Tlaxcallan</i>,
or from certaine Tribes or families of or about <i>Mexico</i>, who helped the first
<i>Spaniards</i> in the conquest of that Country. As for their carriage and behaviour, the
<i>Indians</i> are very courteous and loving, and of a timorous nature, and willing to serve
and to obey, and to doe good, if they be drawn by love; but where they are too much
tyrannized, they are dogged, unwilling to please, or to worke, and will choose rather
strangling and death then life. They are very trusty, and never were known to
commit any robbery of importance; so that the <i>Spaniards</i> dare trust to abide with them
in a wildernesse all night, though they have bags of gold about them. So for secrecy
they are very close; and will not reveal any thing against their own Natives, or a <i>Spaniards</i>
credit and reputation, if they be any way affected to him. But above all unto
their Preist they are very respective unto him; and when they come to speak unto
him; put on their best clothes, study their complements and words to please him. They
are very abundant in their expressions, and full of circumloquutions adorned with parables
and simile's to expresse their mind and intention. I have often sate still for the
space of an houre, onely hearing some old women make their speeches unto me, with
so many elegancies in their tongue (which in <i>English</i> would be non-sense, or barbarous
expressions) as would make me wonder, and learne by their speeches more of
their language, then by any other endeavour or study of mine owne. And if I could
reply unto them in the like phrases and expressions (which I would often endeavour)
I should be sure to win their hearts, and get any thing from them. As for their Religion,
they are outwardly such as the <i>Spaniards</i>, but inwardly hard to beleeve that which
is above sense, nature, and the visible sight of the eye; and many of them to this day doe
incline to worship Idols of stocks and stones, and are given to much superstition, and to
observe crosse waies, and meeting of beasts in them, the flying of birds, their appearing
and singing neer their houses at such and such times. Many are given to witchcraft,
and are deluded by the devill to beleeve that their life dependeth upon the life of such
and such a beast (which they take unto them as their familiar spirit) and think that
when that beast dieth they must die; when he is chased, their hearts pant, when he
is faint they are faint; nay it happeneth that by the devils delusion they appear in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
shape of that Beast, (which commonly by their choice is a Buck, or Doe, a Lion, or
Tigre, or Dog, or Eagle) and in that shape have been shot at and wounded, as I shall
shew in the Chapter following. And for this reason (as I came to understand by some
of them) they yeeld unto the Popish Religion, especially to the worshiping of Saints
Images, because they looke upon them as much like unto their forefathers Idols; and
secondly, because they see some of them painted with Beasts; as <i>Hierom</i> with a Lion,
<i>Anthony</i> with an Asse, and other wild Beasts, <i>Dominick</i> with a Dog, <i>Blas</i> with a Hog,
<i>Mark</i> with a Bull, and <i>John</i> with an Eagle, they are more confirmed in their delusions,
and thinke verily those Saints were of their opinion, and that those beasts were
their familiar spirits, in whose shape they also were transformed when they lived, and
with whom they died. All <i>Indians</i> are much affected unto these Popish Saints, but
especially those which are given to witchcraft, and out of the smalnesse of their means
they will be sure to buy some of these Saints and bring them to the Church, that there
they may stand and be worshipped by them and others. The Churches are full of them,
and they are placed upon standers gilded or painted, to be carried in procession upon
mens shoulders, upon their proper day. And from hence cometh no little profit to the
Preists; for upon such Saints daies, the owner of the Saint maketh a great feast in the
Towne, and presenteth unto the Preist sometimes two or three, sometimes four or five
crownes for his Masse and Sermon, besides a Turkey and three or four fowls, with as
much Cacao as will serve to make him Chocolatte for all the whole <i>Octave</i> or eight
daies following. So that in some Churches, where there are at least fourty of these Saints
Statues and Images, they bring unto the Preist at least fourty pounds a yeer. The Preist
therefore is very watchfull over those Saints daies, and sendeth warning before hand
unto the <i>Indians</i> of the day of their Saint, that they may provide themselves for the
better celebrating it both at home and in the Church. If they contribute not bountifully,
then the Preist will chide, and threaten that he will not preach. Some <i>Indians</i>
through poverty have been unwilling to contribute any thing at all, or to solemnize in
the Church and at his house his Saints day, but then the Preist hath threatned to cast
his Saints image out of the Church, saying, that the Church ought not to be filled
with such Saints as are unprofitable to soul and body, and that in such a statues room
one may stand, which may doe more good by occasioning a solemn celebration of one
day more in the yeer. So likewise if the <i>Indian</i> that owned one of those images die
and leave children, they are to take care of that Saint as part of their inheritance, and
to provide that his day be kept; but if no son, or heirs be left, then the Preist calleth
for the heads of the severall Tribes, and for the chief officers of justice, and maketh a
speech unto them, wherein he declareth that part of the Church ground is taken up
in vain by such an image, and his stander, without any profit either to the Preist, the
Church, or the town, no heir or owner being left alive to provide for that orphan Saint,
to owne it; and that in case they will not seek out who may take charge of him, and
of his day, the Preist will not suffer him to stand idle in his Church, like those whom
our Saviour in the Gospel rebuked, <i>quid hic statis tota die otiosi?</i> for that they stood
idle in the market all the day (these very expressions have I heard there from some Friers)
and therefore that he must banish such a Saints picture out of the Church, and
must deliver him up before them into the Justices hands to be kept by them in the
Town-house, untill such time as he may be bought and owned by some good Christian.
The <i>Indians</i> when they hear these expressions, begin to feare, lest some judgement
may befall their Town for suffering a Saint to be excommunicated and cast out
of their Church, and therefore present unto the Preist some offering for his prayers unto
the Saint, that he may doe them no harme, and desire him to limit them a time to
bring him an answer for the disposing of that Saint (thinking it will prove a disparagement
and affront unto their Town, if what once hath belonged to the Church, be now
out, and delivered up to the secular power) and that in the mean time, they will find
out some good Christian, either of the neerest friends and kindred to him or them
who first owned the Saint, or else some stranger, who may buy that Saint of the
Preist (if he continue in the Church) or of the secular power (if he be cast out of
the Church and delivered up unto them, which they are unwilling to yeeld to, having
been taught of judgements in such a case like to befall them) and may by some speedy
feast and solemnity appease the Saints anger towards them, for having been so sleighted
by the Town. Alas poore <i>Indians</i>, what will they not be brought unto by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Friers and Preists, who study nothing more than their own ends, and to enrich themselves
from the Church and Altar! their policies (who are the wise and prudent children
of this world spoken of in the Gospel) can easily overtop and master the simplicity
of the poor <i>Indians</i>; who rather then they will bring an affront upon their
Towne, by suffering any of their Saints to be cast out of their Church, or to be with
mony redeemed out of the secular powers hands, will make hast to present unto him
an owner of that orphan Saint, who for him shall give to the Preist not only what he
may be prized to be worth in a Painters shop for the workmanship, gold and colours
belonging to him; but besides shall present him what before hath been observed, for
the solemnizing of his Feast. These feasts bring yet unto the Saints more profit then
hitherto hath been spoken of; for the <i>Indians</i> have been taught that upon such daies
they ought to offer up somewhat unto the Saints; and therefore they prepare either
mony (some a Riall, some two, some more) or else commonly about <i>Guatemala</i> white
wax-candles, and in other places Cacao, or fruits, which they lay before the image
of the Saint, whilst the Masse is celebrating. Some <i>Indians</i> will bring a bundle of candles
of a dozen tied together of Rials a peice some, some of three or four for a Riall,
and will if they be let alone light them all together and burne them out, so that the
Preist at the end of the Masse will find nothing but the ends. Therefore (knowing
well of the waies of policy and covetousnesse) he chargeth the Church officers, whom
I said before were called <i>Mayordomo's</i> to looke to the offerings, and not to suffer the <i>Indians</i>
who bring candles to light more then one before the Saint, and to leave the other
before him unlighted (having formerly taught them, that the Saints are as well pleased
with their whole candles as with their burnt candles) that so hee may have the more
to sell and make mony of. After Masse the Preist and the <i>Mayordomo's</i> take and sweep
away from the Saint whatsoever they find hath been offered unto him; so that sometimes
in a great Towne upon such a Saints day the Preist may have in mony twelve or
twenty Rials, and fifty or a hundred candles, which may be worth unto him twenty
or thirty shillings, besides some ends and pieces. Most of the Friers about <i>Guatemala</i>
are with these offerings as wel stored with candles, as is any Wax-chandlers shop
in the City. And the same candles, which thus they have received by offerings they
need not care to sell them away to <i>Spaniards</i>, who come about to buy them (though some
will rather sell them together to such though cheaper, that their mony might come in
all at once) for the <i>Indians</i> themselves when they want again any candles for the like
feast, or for a Christening, and for a womans Churching (at which times they also
offer candles) will buy their own againe of the Preist, who sometimes receiveth the
same candles and mony for them again five or six times. And because they find that the
<i>Indians</i> incline very much to this kind of offerings, and that they are so profitable unto
them, the Friers doe much presse upon the <i>Indians</i> in their preaching this point of
their Religion, and devotion. But if you demand of these ignorant, but zealous offerers
the <i>Indians</i> an account of any point of faith, they will give you little or none.
The mystery of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of Christ, and our redemption
by him is too hard for them; they will only answer what they have been taught in a
Catechisme of questions and answers; but if you ask them if they beleeve such a
point of Christianity, they will never answer affirmatively, but only thus, Perhaps it
may be so. They are taught there the doctrin of <i>Rome</i>, that Christs body is truely
and really present in the Sacrament, and no bread in substance, but only the accidents;
if the wisest <i>Indian</i> be asked, whether he beleeve this, he will answer, Perhaps it may
be so. Once an old woman, who was held to be very religious, in the Town of <i>Mixco</i>,
came to me about receiving the Sacrament, and whilst I was instructing of her, I asked
her if she beleeved that Christ body was in the Sacrament, she answered, Peradventure it
may be so. A little while after to try her and get her out of this strain and common answer,
I asked her what &amp; who was in the Sacrament which she received from the Preists
hand at the Altar; she answered nothing for a while, and at last I pressed upon her for
an affirmative answer; and then she began to looke about to the Saints in the Church,
(which was dedicated to a Saint which they call <i>St. Dominick</i>) and, as it seemed, being
troubled and doubtful what to say, at last she cast her eyes upon the high Altar, but I
seeing she delayed the time, asked her again who was in the Sacrament? to which she replyed
<i>S. Dominick</i> who was the Patron of that Church and Town. At this I smiled, and
would yet further try her simplicity with a simple question. I told her she saw <i>S. Dominick</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was painted with a dog by him holding a torch in his mouth, and the globe of the
world at his feet; I asked her, whether all this were with <i>St. Dominick</i> in the Sacrament?
To which she answered, Perhaps it might be so; wherewith I began to chide
her, and to instruct her. But mine instruction, nor all the teaching and preaching of
those <i>Spanish</i> Preists hath not yet well grounded them in principles of faith; they are
dull and heavie to beleeve or apprehend of God, or of heaven, more then with sense or
reason they can conceive. Yet they goe and run that way they see the <i>Spaniards</i> run,
and as they are taught by their idolatrous Preists. Who have taught them much formality,
and so they are (as our Formalists formerly in <i>England</i>) very formall, but little
substantiall in Religion. They have been taught that when they come to confession,
they must offer somewhat to the Preist, and that by their gifts and almes, their sins
shall be sooner forgiven; this they doe so formally observe, that, whensoever they
come to confession, but especially in Lent, none of them dareth to come with empty
hands; some bring mony, some honey, some egs, some fowls, some fish, some Cacao,
some one thing, some another, so that the Preist hath a plentifull harvest in Lent
for his pains in hearing their Confessions. They have been taught that also when they
receive the Communion, they must surely every one give at least a Riall to the Preist,
(surely <i>England</i> was never taught in <i>America</i> to buy the Sacrament with a two pence
offering, and yet this custome too much practised and pressed upon the people) which
they performe so, that I have known some poor <i>Indians</i>, who have for a week or two
forborne from coming to the Communion untill they could get a Riall offering. It is
to be wondred what the Preists doe get from those poore wretches in great Towns by
Confession and Communion Rials in great Townes, where they denie the Sacrament
to none that will receive it, (and in some Townes I have knowne a thousand Communicants)
and force all above twelve or thirteen yeers of age to come to Confession in
the Lent. They are very formall also in observing <i>Romes</i> Monday, Thursday, and
good-Friday, and then they make their monuments and sepulchres, wherein they
set their Sacrament, and watch it all day and night, placing before it a Crucifix on
the ground, with two basins on each side to hold the single or double Rials, which
every one must offer when he cometh creeping upon his knees, and bare-footed to kisse
Christs hands, feet, and side. The candles which for that day and night and next
morning are burned at the sepulchre are bought with another Contribution-Riall,
which is gathered from house to house from every <i>Indian</i> for that purpose. Their
Religion is a dear and lick-penny religion for such poor <i>Indians</i>, and yet they are carried
along in it formally and perceive it not. They are taught that they must remember
the souls in Purgatory, and therefore that they must cast their almes into a chest, which
standeth for that purpose in their Churches, whereof the Preist keepeth the key, and
openeth it when he wanteth mony, or when he pleaseth. I have often opened some
of those chests; and have found in them many single Rials, some halfe pieces of eight,
and some whole pieces of eight. And because what is lost and found in the high-waies,
must belong to some body, if the true owner be not knowne, they have been taught
that such monies or goods belong also to the soules departed; wherefore the <i>Indians</i>
(surely more for fear or vanities sake that they may be well thought on by the Preist)
if they find any thing lost will bestow it upon the soules surer then the <i>Spaniards</i> themselves
(who if they find a purse lost will keep it,) and will bring it either to the Preist
or cast it into the chest. An <i>Indian</i> of <i>Mixco</i> had found a patacon or peece of eight in
a high-way, and when he came to Confession, he gave it unto me telling me he durst
not keep it, lest the soules should appear unto him, and demand it. So upon the second
day of <i>November</i> which they call All soules day, they are extraordinary foolish
and superstitious in offering monies, fowles, egs and Maiz, and other commodities
for the soules good, but it proves for the profit of the Preist, who after Masse wipes
away to his chamber all that which the poore gulled and deluded <i>Indians</i> had offered
unto those soules, which needed neither mony, food, nor any other provision, and
he fills his purse, and pampers his belly with it. A Frier that lived in <i>Petapa</i> boasted
unto me once that upon their All Soules day, his offerings had been about a hundred
Rials, two hundred Chickens and fowls, half a dozen Turkeyes, eight bushels of
Maiz, three hundred egs, four sontles of Cacao, (every sontle being four hundred
granes) twenty clusters of plantins, above a hundred wax candles, besides some
loaves of bread, and other trifles of fruits. All which being summed up according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to the price of the things there, and with consideration of the coyn of mony there
(halfe a Ryall or three pence being there the least coyn) mounts to above eight pounds
of our money, a faire and goodly stipend for a Masse, brave wages for halfe an houres
work; a politick ground for that Error of Purgatory, if the dead bring to the living
Preist such wealth in one day onely. Christmas day with the rest of those holy daies
is no lesse superstitiously observed by these <i>Indians</i>; for against that time they frame
and set in some corner of their Church a little thatched house like a stall, which they
call <i>Bethlehem</i>, with a blazing Starre over, pointing it unto the three Sage wise men from
the East; within this stall they lay in a Crib, a child made of wood, painted and
guilded (who represents Christ new borne unto them) by him stands <i>Mary</i> on the one
side, and <i>Joseph</i> on the other, and an Asse likewise on the one side and an oxe on the
other, made by hands, the three wise men of the East kneel before the Crib offering
gold, Frankincense and Myrrhe, the shepheards stand aloof off offering their Country
gifts, some a Kid, some a Lambe, some Milk, some Cheese, and Curds, some fruits, the
fields are also there represented with flocks of Sheep and Goats; the Angels they hang
about the stall some with Vialls, some with Lutes, some with Harps, a goodly mumming
and silent stage play, to draw those simple souls to look about, and to delight their senses
and fantasies in the Church.</p>

<p>There is not an <i>Indian</i> that cometh to see that supposed <i>Bethlehem</i> (and there is
not any in the Town but doth come to see it) who bringeth not either money or
somewhat else for his offering. Nay the policy of the Preists hath been such, that
(to stirre up the <i>Indians</i> with their Saints example) they have taught them to bring
their Saints upon all the holy dayes, untill Twelfth day in Procession unto this <i>Bethlehem</i>
to offer their gifts, according to the number of the Saints that stand in the Church,
some daies there come five, some daies eight, some daies ten, dividing them into such
order, that by Twelfth day all may have come and offered, some money, some one thing,
some another; The owner of the Saint, hee cometh before the Saint with his friends
and kindred (if there bee no sodality or company belonging unto that Saint) and
being very well apparelled for that purpose, he bowes himselfe and kneels to the Crib,
and then rising takes from the Saint what hee bringeth and leaveth it there, and so
departs. But if there be a sodality belonging to the Saint, then the Mayordomo's or
chief Officers of that company they come before the Saint, and doe homage, and offer
as before hath been said. But upon Twelfth day the Alcaldes, Maiors, Jurates,
and other Officers of Justice, must offer after the example of the Saints, and the three
Wise men of the East (whom the Church of <i>Rome</i> teacheth to have been Kings) because
they represent the Kings power and authority. And all these daies they have
about the Town and in the Church a dance of Shepheards, who at Christmas Eve at
midnight begin before this <i>Bethlehem</i>, and then they must offer a Sheep amongst them.
Others dance clothed like Angels and with wings, and all to draw the people more
to see sights in the Church, then to worship God in Spirit and in Truth. Candlemas
day is no lesse superstitiously observed; for then the picture of <i>Mary</i> comes in procession
to the Altar, and offereth up her Candles and Pigeons, or Turtle-Doves unto the Preist,
and all the Town must imitate her example, and bring their Candles to be blessed and
hallowed; of foure or five, or as many as they bring, one onely shall bee restored back
unto them, because they are blessed, all the rest are for the Preist, to whom the <i>Indians</i>
resort after to buy them, and give more then ordinary, because they are hallowed Candles.
At Whitsontide they have another sight, and that is in the Church also, whilst
a Hymne is sung of the Holy Ghost, the Preist standing before the Altar with his face
turned to the people, they have a device to let fall a Dove from above over his head well
dressed with flowers, and for above half an houre, from holes made for that purpose, they
drop down flowers about the Preist shewing the gifts of the holy Ghost to him, which
example the ignorant and simple <i>Indians</i> are willing to imitate, offering also their
gifts unto him. Thus all the yeer are those Preists and Fryers deluding the poore people
for their ends, enriching themselves with their gifts, placing Religion in meer
Policy; and thus doth the <i>Indians</i> Religion consist more in sights, shewes and formalities,
then in any true substance. But as sweet meat must have sowre sawce; so this
sweetnesse and pleasing delight of shewes in the Church hath its sowre sawce once a
yeer (besides the sowrenesse of poverty which followeth to them by giving so many gifts
unto the Preist) for, to shew that in their Religion there is some bitterness, &amp; sowrenesse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
they make the <i>Indians</i> whip themselves the weeke before Easter, like the <i>Spaniards</i>,
which those simples both men and women perform with such cruelty to their owne
flesh, that they butcher it, mangle and teare their backs, till some swound, nay some (as I
have known) have died under their own whipping, and have selfe murthered themselves,
which the Preists regard not, because their death is sure to bring them at least three
or foure Crownes for a Masse for their soules, and other offerings of their
friends.</p>

<p>Thus in Religion they are superstitiously led on, and blinded in the observance
of what they have been taught more for the good and profit of their Preists, then for any
good of their soules, not perceiving that their Religion is a Policy to inrich their
teachers. But not onely doe the Fryers and Preists live by them and eat the sweat of
their browes; but also all the <i>Spaniards</i>, who not onely with their worke and service
(being themselves many given to idlenesse) grow wealthy and rich; but with needlesse
offices, and authority are still fleecing them, and taking from them that little which
they gaine with much hardnesse and severity.</p>

<p>The President of <i>Guatemala</i>, the Judges of that Chancery, the Governours and High
Justices of other parts of the Country, that they may advance and inrich their meniall
servants, make the poor <i>Indians</i> the subject of their bountifulnesse towards such. Some
have offices to visit as often as they please their Towns, and to see what every <i>Indian</i> hath
sowed of Maiz, for the maintenance of his wife and children; Others visit them to
see what fowles they keepe for the good and store of the County; others have order
to see whether their houses bee decently kept and their beds orderly placed according
to their Families; others have power to call them out to mend and repaire the high
wayes, and others have Commission to number the Families and Inhabitants of the
severall Townes, to see how they increase that their Tribute may not decrease, but still
bee raised. And all this, those officers doe never perform but so, that for their pains
they must have from every <i>Indian</i> an allowance to bear their charges, (which indeed
are none at all) for as long as they stay in the Town, they may call for what fowles
and provision they please without paying for it. When they come to number the
Townes, they call by list every <i>Indian</i> and cause his children, sonnes and daughters to
be brought before them, to see if they bee fit to be married; and if they be of growth and
age, and bee not married, the fathers are threatned for keeping them unmarried, and as
idle livers in the Towne without paying tribute; and according to the number of the
sonnes and daughters that are marriageable, the fathers tribute is raised and increased,
untill they provide husbands and wives for their sons and daughters, who as
soone as they are married, are charged with tribute; which that it may increase, they
will suffer none above fifteen yeers of age to live unmarried; Nay the set time of age of
marriage appointed for the <i>Indians</i>, is at fourteen yeers for the man, and thirteene
for the woman, alleadging that they are sooner ripe for the fruit of Wedlock, and sooner
ripe in knowledge and malice, and strength for worke and service, then are any other
people. Nay sometimes they force them to marry who are scarce twelve and thirteene
yeeres of age, if they find them well limbed, and strong in body, explicating
a point of one of <i>Romes</i> Canons, which alloweth fourteene and fifteen yeers, <i>nisi malitia
suppleat ætatem</i>. When I my selfe lived in <i>Pinola</i>, that Town by order of <i>Don Juan
de Guzman</i>, (a great Gentleman of <i>Guatemala</i>, to whom it belonged) was numbred, and
an increase of tributary <i>Indians</i> was added unto it by this meanes. The numbring it
lasted a full week, and in that space I was commanded to joyne in marriage neer twenty
couple, which, with those that before had been married since the last numbring of it,
made up to the Encomendero or Lord of it an increase of about fifty Families. But it was
a shame to see how young some were that at that time were forced to marriage, neither
could al my striving and reasoning prevail to the contrary, nor the producing of the Register
Book to shew their age, but that some were married of between twelve and thirteene
yeers of age, and one especially who in the Register booke was found to bee not fully
of twelve yeers, whose knowledge and strength of body was judged to supply the want
of age. In this manner even in the most free act of the will, (which ought to bee in
marriage) are those poore <i>Indians</i>, forced and made slaves by the <i>Spaniards</i>, to supply
with tribute the want of their purses, and the meannesse of their Estates. Yet under
this yoke and burden they are cheerfull, and much given to feasting, sporting and
dancing, as they particularly shew in the chief feasts of their Townes, which are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
upon that Saints day to whom their Town is dedicated. And certainly this superstition
hath continued also in <i>England</i> from the Popish times, to keep Faires in many of our
Towns upon Saints dayes (which is the intent of the Papists to draw in the people and
country by way of commerce and trading one with another, to honor, worship, and pray
to that Saint, to whom the Town is dedicated) or else why are our Faires commonly
kept upon <i>John Baptist, James, Peter, Matthew, Bartholomew, Holy Rood, Lady</i> dayes,
and the like, and not as well a day or two before, or a day or two after, which would
bee as good and fit dayes to buy and sell, as the other? True it is, our Reformation
alloweth not the worshipping of Saints, yet that solemne meeting of the people to Fairs
and mirth, and sport upon those daies it hath kept and continued, that so the Saints
and their dayes may bee and continue still in our remembrance. There is no Town
in the <i>India's</i> great or small (though it be but of twenty Families) which is not dedicated
thus unto our Lady or unto some Saint, and the remembrance of that Saint is continued
in the mindes not onely of them that live in the Towne, but of all that live
farre and neere by commercing, trading, sporting, and dancing, offering unto the Saint,
and bowing, kneeling, and praying before him. Before this day day cometh, the
<i>Indians</i> of the Town two or three Moneths have their meetings at night, and prepare
themselves for such dances as are most commonly used amongst them; and in these their
meetings they drinke much both of Chocolatte and Chicha. For every kind of dance
they have severall houses appointed, and masters of that dance, who teach the rest that
they may bee perfected in it against the Saints day. For the most part of these two or
three moneths the silence of the night is unquieted, what with their singing, what
with their hollowing, what with their beating upon the shels of fishes, what with their
Waits, and what with their piping. And when the feast cometh, then they act publikely,
and for the space of eight dayes, what privately they had practised before. They
are that day well apparelled with silkes, fine linnen, ribbands and feathers according
to the dance; which first they begin in the Church before the Saint, or in the
Church yard, and from thence all the <i>Octave</i>, or eight dayes they goe from house to
house dancing, where they have Chocolatte or some heady drink or Chicha given them.
All those eight daies the Towne is sure to bee full of drunkards; and if they bee reprehended
for it; they will answer, that their heart doth rejoyce with their Saint
in heaven, and that they must drinke unto him, that hee may remember them. The
chief dance used amongst them is called Toncontin, which hath been danced before
the King of <i>Spain</i>, in the Court of <i>Madrid</i> by <i>Spaniards</i>, who have lived in the <i>India's</i>
to shew unto the King somewhat of the <i>Indians</i> fashions; and it was reported to have
pleased the King very much. This dance is thus performed. The <i>Indians</i> commonly that
dance it (if it bee a great Towne) are thirty or forty, or fewer, if it be a small Town.
They are clothed in white, both their dublets, linnen drawers, and Aiates, or towels,
which on the one side hang almost to the ground. Their drawers and Aiates are
wrought with some workes of Silk, or with birds, or bordered with some Lace.
Others procure dublets and drawers and Aiates of Silk, all which are hired for that
purpose. On their backs they hang long tuffes of feathers of all colours, which
with glew are fastned into a little frame made for the purpose, and guilded on the outside;
this frame with Ribbands they tie about their shoulders fast that it fall not, nor
slacken with the motion of their bodies. Upon their heads they wear another lesse
tuffe of Feathers either in their hats, or in some guilded or painted head-peece, or helmet.
In their hands also they carry a fan of feathers, and on their feet most will use
feathers also bound together like short wings of birds; some weare shooes, some not.
And thus from top to toe they are almost covered with curious and coloured feathers.
Their Musick and tune to this dance is onely what is made with a hollow stock of a
tree, being rounded, and well pared within and without, very smooth and shining,
some foure times thicker then our viols, with two or three long clefts on the upper
side and some holes at the end which they call <i>Tepanabaz</i>. On this stock (which is placed
upon a stool or fourm in the middle of the <i>Indians</i>) the Master of the dance beates
with two sticks, covered with wooll at the ends, and a pitched leather over the wooll
that it fall not away. With this Instrument and blowes upon it (which soundeth but
dull and heavy, but somewhat loud) hee giveth the dancers their severall tunes, and
changes, and signes of the mothion of their bodies either straight or bowing, and giveth
them warning what and when they are to sing. Thus they dance in compasse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
circle round about that instrument, one following another sometimes straight, sometimes
turning about, sometimes turning half way, sometimes bending their bodies and
with the feathers in their hands almost touching the ground, and singing the life of
that their Saint, or of some other. All this dancing is but a kind of walking round,
which they will continue two or three whole houres together in one place, and from
thence goe and perform the same at another house.</p>

<p>This Toncontin the chief and principall onely of the Towne doe dance it; It was
the old dance which they used before they knew Christianity, except that then in stead
of singing the Saints lives, they did sing the praises of their heathenish Gods. They
have another dance much used, which is a kind of hunting out some wild Beast
(which formerly in time of Heathenisme was to bee sacrificed to their Gods) to bee
offered up unto the Saint. This dance hath much variety of tunes, with a small Tepanabaz,
and many shels of Tortoi's, or in stead of them with pots covered with leather,
on which they strike as on Tepanabaz, and with the sound of pipes; in this
dance they use much hollowing and noise and calling one unto another, and speaking
by way of Stage play, some relating one thing, some another concerning the
Beast they hunt after; these dancers are all cloathed like Beasts, with painted skins
of Lions, Tigers, Wolves, and on their heads such headpieces as may represent the
head of such Beasts, and other weare painted heads of Eagles or Fowles of rapine,
and in their hands they have painted Staves, Bils, Swords and Axes, wherewith they
threaten to kill that Beast they hunt after. Others in stead of hunting after a Beast,
hunt after a man, as Beasts in a wildernesse should hunt a man to kill him. This man
that is thus hunted after must bee very nimble and agil, as one flying for his life, and
striking here and there at the Beasts for his defence, whom at last they catch and
make a prey of. As the Toncontin consists most of walking and turning and leasurely
bending their bodies, so this dance doth wholly consist in action, running in a circle
round, sometimes out of circle, and leaping and striking with those tooles and instruments
which they have in their hand. This is a very rude sport, and full of scrieking
and hideous noise, wherein I never delighted. Another <i>Mexican</i> dance they use, some
clothed like men, others like women, which in Heathenish times they did use with
singing praises unto their King or Emperour; but now they apply their songs unto
the King of Glory, or unto the Sacrament, using these or commonly the like words
with very little difference, and some variety of praise,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Salid Mexicanas, bailad Toncontin.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cansalas galanas en cuerpo gentil.</i> And againe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Salid Mexicanas bailad Toncontin.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Al Rey de la gloria tenemos aqui.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus they goe round dancing, playing in some
places very well upon their Guitarres, repeating now and then all together a verse or
two, and calling the <i>Mexican</i> Dames to come out to them with their gallant Mantles to
sing praise unto their King of Glory. Besides these they have, and use our Morris dances,
and Blackmore dances with Sonajas in their hands, which are a round set of small
Morris dancing bells, wherewith they make variety of sounds to their nimble feet.
But the dance which doth draw to it the peoples wondering is a Tragedy acted by
way of dance, as the death of St. <i>Peter</i>, or the beheading of <i>John</i> the <i>Baptist</i>. In
these dances there is an Emperour, or a King <i>Herod</i> with their Queens clothed, another
cloathed with a long loose Coat who represents St. <i>Peter</i>, or <i>John</i> the <i>Baptist</i>,
who whilst the rest danceth, walketh amongst them with a book in his hands, as if
hee were saying his prayers, all the rest of the Dancers are apparelled like Captaines
and souldiers with Swords, Daggers, or Holbards in their hands. They
dance at the sound of a small drum and pipes, sometimes round, sometimes
in length forward, and have and use many speeches to the Emperour or King, and among
themselves concerning the apprehending and executing the Saint. The King
and Queen sit sometimes down to hear their pleading against the Saint, and his pleading
for himselfe; and sometimes they dance with the rest; and the end of their
dance is to crucifie St. <i>Peter</i> downwards with his head upon a Crosse, or behead <i>John</i>
the <i>Baptist</i>, having in readinesse a painted head in a dish, which they present unto
the King and Queen, for joy whereof they all again dance merrily and so conclude, taking
down him that acted <i>Peter</i> from the Crosse. The <i>Indians</i> that dance this dance
most of them are superstitious for what they do, judging as if it were indeed really acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and performed what onely is by way of dance represented. When I lived amongst
them, it was an ordinary thing for him who in the dance was to act St. <i>Peter</i> or <i>John</i>
the <i>Baptist</i>, to come first to Confession, saying they must bee holy and pure like that
Saint, whom they represent, and must prepare themselves to die. So likewise hee
that acted <i>Herod</i> or <i>Herodias</i>, and some of the Souldiers that in the dance were to speak
and to accuse the Saints, would afterwards come to confesse of that sinne, and desire
absolution as from bloodguiltinesse. More particular passages of the <i>Indians</i> according
to my experience of them, I shall in the Chapter following truly relate unto my
Reader.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="CHAP_XX" id="CHAP_XX">CHAP. XX.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing how and why I departed out of</i> Guatemala <i>to learne the Poconchi
language, and to live among the</i> Indians, <i>and of some particular passages and
accidents whilst I lived there.</i></h4>


<p>Having read in the University of <i>Guatemala</i> for three years space a whole
course of Arts, and having begun to read part of Divinity, the more I studied
and grew in knowledge, and the more I controverted by way of Arguments
some Truths and points of Religion, the more I found the spirit of
Truth inlightening me, and discovering unto me the lies, errors, falsities and superstitions
of the Church of <i>Rome</i>. My conscience was much perplexed, and wavering, and I desirous
of some good and full satisfaction: Which I knew might not bee had there;
and that to professe and continue in any opinion contrary to the Doctrine of <i>Rome</i>,
would bring mee to the Inquisition, that Rack of tender Consciences, and from thence
to no lesse then burning alive, in case I would not recant of what the true Spirit had
inspired into mee. The point of Transubstantiation, of Purgatory, of the Popes
power and authority, of the merit of mans workes, of his free will to choose all soul-saving
wayes, the sacrifice of the Masse, the halving the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper unto the Lay people, the Preists power to absolve from sinne, the worshipping
of Saints though with &#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;, as they call it, and not with &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945;, and the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> with a higher degree of worship then that of the Saints, which they
call &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#949;&#943;&#945;, the strange lies and blasphemies which they call miracles recorded in the
Legend and lives of their Saints, the infallibility of the Pope, and councell in defining
for truth and point of Faith, what in it selfe is false and erroneous; these points
especially, with many more of <i>Romes</i> policies, and the lewd lives of the Preists, Fryers,
Nuns, and those in authority, did much trouble and perplex my conscience, which I
knew would bee better satisfied if I could returne againe to my owne Countrey of
<i>England</i>, where I knew many things were held contrary to the Church of <i>Rome</i>, but
what particulars they were, I could not tell, not having been brought up in the Protestant
Church, and having been sent young over to <i>St. Omers</i>. Wherefore I earnestly addressed
my selfe to the Provincial; and to the President of <i>Guatemala</i>, for a licence to
come home, but neither of them would yeeld unto it, because there was a strict order
of the King and Councell, that no Preist sent by his Majesty to any of the parts
of the <i>India's</i> to Preach the Gospell, should return againe to <i>Spain</i> till ten yeers were
expired. Hereupon I seeing my self a Prisoner, and without hopes for the present
of seeing <i>England</i> in many yeers, resolved to stay no more in <i>Guatemala</i>, but to goe
out to learne some <i>Indian</i> tongue, and to preach in some of their Townes, where I
knew more money might bee got to help mee home, when the time should come, then
if I did continue to live in the Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>. Yet in the mean time I thought
it not unfit to write to <i>Spain</i> to a friend of mine an <i>English</i> Fryer in <i>San Lucar</i>, called
Fryer <i>Pablo de Londres</i> to desire him to obtain for mee a License from the Court, and
from the Generall of the Order at <i>Rome</i>, that I might return unto my Country. In
this season there was in <i>Guatemala</i>, Fryer <i>Francisco de Moran</i>, the Prior of <i>Coban</i> in the
Province of <i>Vera Paz</i>, who was informing the President and whole Chancery, how
necessary it was that some <i>Spaniards</i> should bee ayding and assisting him for the discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of a way from that Country unto <i>Jucatan</i>, and for the suppressing of such barbarous
people and Heathens, as stopped his passage, and did often invade some <i>Indian</i> Towns
of Christians. This <i>Moran</i> (being my speciall friend, and having been brought up in
<i>Spaine</i> in the Cloister of <i>San Pablo de Valladolid</i>, where my selfe was first entred Frier,)
was very desirous of my company along with him, for the better bringing into Christianity
those Heathens, and Idolaters, telling me that doubtlesse in a new Countrey
new treasure and great riches was like to be found, whereof no small share and portion
should befall him and me for our pains and adventure. I was not hard to be perswaded,
being above all desirous to convert to Christianity a people that had never
heard of Christ; and so purposed to forsake that honour which I had in the Universitie,
for to make Christ knowne unto that Heathenish people. The Provinciall was
glad to see this my courage, and so with some gifts and mony in my purse, sent me with
<i>Moran</i> to the <i>Vera Paz</i> in the company of 50. <i>Spaniards</i>, who were appointed by the
President to aid and assist us.</p>

<p>When we came to <i>Coban</i> we were well refreshed and provided for a hard and dangerous
enterprize. From <i>Coban</i> we marched to two great Townes of Christians called
<i>St. Peter</i>, and <i>St. John</i>, where were added unto us a hundred <i>Indians</i> for our further assistance.
From these Towns two daies journey we could travail on Mules safely among
Christians and some small villages; but after the two daies we drew neer unto the Heathens
Frontiers, where there was no more open way for Mules, but we must trust unto
our feet. We went up and down mountaines amongst woods for the space of two daies,
being much discouraged with the thickets and hardnesse of the way, and having no
hope of finding out the Heathens. In the night we kept watch and guard for feare of
enemies, and resolved yet the third day to goe forward. In the mountaines we found
many sorts of fruits and in the bottomes springs and brookes with many trees of Cacao
and Achiotte. The third day we went on, and came to a low valley, in the midst
whereof ran a shallow river, where we found some <i>Milpa's</i> or plantations of Maiz.
These were a testimony unto us of some <i>Indians</i> not far off, and therefore made us
keep together and be in readinesse, if any assault or onset should be made upon us by
the Heathens. Whilst we thus travelled on, we suddenly fell upon halfe a dozen poore
cottages, covered with boughes and plantin leaves, and in them wee found three <i>Indian</i>
women, two men and five young children, all naked, who faine would have
escaped, but they could not. We refreshed our selves in their poore cottages and gave
them of our provision, which at the first they refused to eat, howling and crying and
pulling, till <i>Moran</i> had better incouraged and comforted them, whose language
they partly understood. We clothed them and tooke them along with us, hoping
to make them discover unto us some treasure or some bigger plantation. But that day
they were so sullen that we could get nothing out of them. Thus we went on, following
some tracks which here and there we found of <i>Indians</i>, till it was almost evening,
and then we did light upon above a dozen cottages more, and in them a matter of
twenty men, women, and children, from whom we tooke some bows and arrowes,
and found there store of plantins, some fish, and wild Venison, wherewith we refreshed
our selves. These told us of a great Towne two daies journey off, which made us be
very watchfull that night. Here I began with some more of our company to be sick and
weary, so that the next day I was not able to goe any further; whereupon we resolved
to set up our quarters there, and to send out some scouts of <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>
to discover the country, who found further more cottages and plantations of Maiz,
of Chile, of Turkey beans, and Cotton-wooll, but no <i>Indians</i> at all, for they were all
fled. Our scouts returned, and gave us some incouragement from the pleasantnesse
of the Country; but withall wished us to be watchfull and carefull, for that certainly
the flight of those <i>Indians</i> was a signe that our coming was noised about the Country.
The next day we purposed to move forward to that plantation which our scouts
had discovered, being (as we were informed) safer and more open to foresee any
danger ready to befall us. All these plantations lay along by the river, where the sun
was exceeding hot, which had caused feavers and a flux in some of us. With much
wearinesse and faintnesse I got that day to our journeys end, beginning now to repent
mee of what I was ingaged in and on foot, and fearing some suddain danger, by reason
our coming was now known by the <i>Indians</i>. The prisoners we had with us began to
tell us of some gold that they did sometimes find in that river, and of a great lake yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
forward, about which did inhabit many thousand <i>Indians</i>, who were very warlike,
and skilfull in their bows and arrows. The one incouraged some, the other much
discouraged the rest, who wished themselves out of those woods and unknown places,
and began to murmur against <i>Moran</i>, who had been the cause of their ingagement in
that great danger. Our night was set, and I and the rest of the sick <i>Spaniards</i> went to rest,
some upon the bare ground, but my self and others in hamacca's, which are of net work
tied at two posts or trees, and hanging in the aire, which with the least stirring of the
body, rocke one asleep as in a Cradle. Thus I tooke my rest till about midnight; at
which time our watches gave an alarm against our approaching enemies, who were
thought to be about a thousand. They came desperately towards us, and when they
saw they were discovered, and our drums beat up, and our fowling peeces and muskets
began to shoot, they hollowed and cried out with a hideous noise, which uproar and
suddain affrightment, added sweat and fear to my feaver. But <i>Moran</i> (who came to
confesse with mee, and to prepare himselfe for death or for some deadly wound) comforted
me, wishing me to fear nothing, and to lie still, for that I could doe them no
good, and that lesse was my danger then I apprehended, because our Souldiers had
compassed me about, so that on no side the Heathens could come in, and flie we could
not without the losse of all our lives. The skirmish lasted not above an hour, and then
our enemies began to flie back. We tooke ten of them, and in the morning found
thirteen dead upon the ground, and of ours five onely were wounded, whereof one
died the next day.</p>

<p>In the morning our Souldiers began to mutiny and to talke of returning back, fearing
a worse and more violent onset that day or the night following, for some of the
<i>Indians</i> who were taken, told them plainly that if they went not away there would
come six or seven thousand against them. They told us further, that they knew well
that the <i>Spaniards</i> had all the country about, except that little portion of theirs, which
they desired to enjoy quietly and peaceably, and not to meddle with us, but rather if
we would see their countrey and goe through it as friends, they would let us without
doing us any hurt; but if we came in a warlike manner to fight and to bring them into
slavery, as we had done their neighbours, they were all resolved to die fighting rather
then to yeeld. With these words our Souldiers were divided, some with <i>Moran</i> were of
opinion to try the <i>Indians</i>, and to go peaceably through their Country til they could
come to some Towne of <i>Jucatan</i>; others were of opinion to fight, others to return
back again, considering their weakenesse against so many thousands of <i>Indians</i> as
were in the Country. But that day nothing was agreed upon, for that we could not
stir by reason of the sick and wounded. So we continued there that night, and as the
night before much about the same time the enemies came againe upon us, but finding us
ready and watching for them, they soone fled. In the morning we resolved to returne
back, and <i>Moran</i> sent the Heathens word, that if they would let him goe through their
country quietly to discover some land of <i>Jucatan</i>, he would after a few monthes come
peaceably unto them with halfe a dozen <i>Indians</i>, no more, trusting his life upon them;
whom he knew if they wronged, all the <i>Spaniards</i> in the country would rise up against
them, and not leave one alive. They answered that they would entertaine him,
and any few <i>Indians</i> well and willingly; all which <i>Moran</i> and they performed according
to their agreement the next yeer following.</p>

<p>Thus we returned that day backe the same way that we had come, and I began to find
my self better, and my feaver to leave me. We carried with us some of those young children
which we had taken, to present them unto the President of <i>Guatemala</i>. And in <i>Coban</i>
the Prior <i>Moran</i> thought he might first do God good service if he christened those yong
children, saying that they might become Saints, and that afterwards their prayers
might prevaile with God for the conversion of their parents and of all that country
to Christianity. I could not but oppose this his ignorance, which seemed much like
unto that of the Friers who entred <i>America</i> with <i>Cortez</i>, and increased after the conquest
daily more in number, who boasted to the Emperour, that they had
some of them made above thirty thousand <i>Indians</i> Christians by baptizing them;
which truely they did as sheep are forced to the waters and driven to be washed; so were
those first <i>Indians</i> by thousands sprinkled (or if I may use their word, baptized) for
they were driven by compulsion &amp; force to the rivers, neither were they first principled
in any grounds of belief and Christianity, neither themselves beleevers, nor children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of beleeving and faithfull parents. So would <i>Moran</i> christen these children, though
I told him that they ought not to partake of that sacrament and Ordinance of Christ,
unlesse they were grounded in articles of Christianity and beleeved, or were children
of beleeving parents. But as he had been brought up in errours, whereof that Church
of <i>Rome</i> is a wide and spatious nest, so he would be obstinate in this point against me
and the truth, sprinkling with water those children, and naming them with names
of Christians. After this he sent them well apparelled to the President of <i>Guatemala</i>,
who commanded them to be kept, and brought up in the Cloister of the Dominican
Friers.</p>

<p>I remained after this for a while in <i>Coban</i>, and in the Townes about, untill such
time as the ships came to the Gulfe; whither I went with <i>Moran</i> to buy wines, oyle,
iron, cloth and such things as the Cloister wanted for the present. At which time
there being a frigate ready to depart to <i>Truxillo</i> (some occasions drawing <i>Moran</i> thither)
I tooke ship with him. We staied not much above a week in that Port (which
is a weak one, as the <i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i> taking of it can witnesse) but presently we
thought of returning back to <i>Guatemala</i> by land through the countrey of <i>Comayagua</i>,
commonly called <i>Honduras</i>. This is a woody and mountainous countrey, very bad and
inconvenient for Travellers, and besides very poore; there the commodities are Hides,
<i>Canna fistula</i>, and <i>Zarzaparilla</i>, and such want of bread, that about <i>Truxillo</i> they make
use of what they call <i>Cassave</i>, which is a dry root, that being eaten dry doth choak, and
therefore is soaked in broth, water, wine or Chocolatte, that so it may go down. Within
the Countrey, and especially about the City of <i>Comayagua</i> (which is a Bishops seat,
though a small place of some five hundred inhabitants at the most) there is more store
of Maiz by reason of some <i>Indians</i>, which are gathered to Townes, few and small. I
found this Countrey one of the poorest in all <i>America</i>. The chief place in it for health
and good living is the valley which is called <i>Gracias a Dios</i>, there are some rich farms
of Cattle and Wheat; but because it lieth as neer to the Countrey of <i>Guatemala</i> as to
<i>Comayagua</i>, and on this side the waies are better then on that, therefore more of
that Wheat is transported to <i>Guatemala</i> and to the Townes about it, then to <i>Comayagua</i>
or <i>Truxillo</i>. From <i>Truxillo</i> to <i>Guatemala</i> there are between fourescore and a hundred
leagues, which we travelled by land, not wanting in a barren Countrey neither guides
nor provision, for the poore <i>Indians</i> thought neither their personall attendance, nor
any thing that they enjoyed too good for us.</p>

<p>Thus we came again to <i>Guatemala</i>, and were by the Friers joyfully entertained, and
by the President highly rewarded, and by the City called true Apostles, because we had
ventured our lives for the discovery of Heathens, and opened a way for their conversion,
and found out the chief place of their residence, and sent before us those children
to the City, who witnessed with being in the Cloister our pains and indeavours. <i>Moran</i>
was so puffed up with the Presidents favour, and the popular applause, that he resolved
in <i>Guatemala</i> to venture again his life, and, according to that message which he had
sent before to the Heathen <i>Indians</i>, to enter amongst them in a peaceable way with
halfe a dozen <i>Indians</i>. He would fain have had me gone with him; but I considered
the hardnesse of the journey, which I thought I should not be able to perform on foot;
and also I feared that the <i>Barbarians</i> might mutiny against us for those children which
we had brought; and lastly I liked not the Countrey, which seemed poore and not for
my purpose, to get meanes sufficient to bring me home to <i>England</i>, which was the
chiefest thought and desire of my heart for the satisfaction of my conscience, which I
found still unquiet. Wherefore I resolved to forsake the company of my friend <i>Moran</i>,
and to desist from new discoveries of Heathens, and such difficult undertakings, which
might endanger my health and life, and at last bring no profit, but only a little vain
glory, fame and credit in that Countrey. I thought I might better employ my time,
if I learned some <i>Indian</i> tongue neerer to <i>Guatemala</i>, where I considered the riches of
the Townes, the readinesse of the <i>Indians</i>, and their willingnesse to further their Preists
wants; and lastly, their ignorance in some points of Religion, which I thought I
might help and clear with some sound doctrin, and with preaching Christ crucified unto
them, and bringing them unto that rock of eternall blisse and salvation. I trusted in
my friends so much, that I knew it would not be hard for me to take my choice of any
place about <i>Guatemala</i>; from whence I might facilitate my returne to <i>England</i>, and
write to <i>Spain</i>, and have every yeer an answer easier then any where else. I opened my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
mind unto the Provinciall (who was then at <i>Guatemala</i>) and he presently and willingly
condescended to my request, and counselled me to learn the <i>Poconchi</i> language, (whereof
I had already got some grounds in the <i>Vera Paz</i>) which is most used about <i>Guatemala</i>,
and also is much practised in <i>Vera Paz</i>, and in the Countrey of <i>San Salvador</i>.
He promised to send me to the Town of <i>Petapa</i>, to learne there the language, with a
speciall friend of his named Frier <i>Peter Molina</i>, who was very old, and wanted the
help and company of some younger person to ease him in the charge that lay upon
him, of so great a Towne, and many Travellers that passed that way. The Provinciall
as if he had knowne my mind, pitched upon my very hearts desire; and thus two
weeks before <i>Midsummer</i> day I departed from <i>Guatemala</i> to <i>Petapa</i>, which is six leagues
from thence, and there setled my selfe to learn that <i>Indian</i> tongue. The Friers of those
parts that are any way skilful in the <i>Indian</i> languages, have composed Grammars &amp; Dictionaries
for the better furthering of others who may supply their places after their
decease; but whilst they live are unwilling to teach the languages unto others, lest their
schollers should after a good and well grounded knowledge of the tongues, supplant
their own Masters, and be means of taking from them that great profit which they
have by living as Curates in the <i>Indian</i> Townes. Yet this old <i>Molina</i> considering himselfe
in yeers, and for his good friends sake the Provinciall, was not unwilling to accept
of my company, and to impart unto me what knowledge he had got by many yeers
practice of the <i>Poconchi</i> tongue. He gave me therefore a short abstract of all the rudiments
belonging unto it, which did consist chiefely of declining Nounes, and conjugating
Verbs, (which I easily learned in the first fortnight that I had been with him) and
then a Dictionary of <i>Indian</i> words, which was all the rest of my study to get without
book, untill I was able of my selfe to preach unto the <i>Indians</i>, which with much
easinesse I obtained by discoursing and conferring with them, what with my private
study I had learned.</p>

<p>After the first six weeks <i>Molina</i> writ downe for me in the tongue a short exhortation,
which he expounded to me, and wished me to learne it without booke, which I preached
publikely upon the feast of <i>St. James</i>. After this he gave me another short exhortation
in <i>Spanish</i>, to be preached upon the fifteenth of <i>August</i>, which he made me
translate into the <i>Indian</i> tongue, and he corrected in it what he found amisse, wherewith
I was a little more emboldened, and feared not to shew my selfe in publick to the
<i>Indians</i>. This practice I continued three or four times untill <i>Michaelmas</i>, preaching
what with his help I had translated out of <i>Spanish</i>, untill I was able to talke with the
<i>Indians</i> alone, and to make mine own Sermons. After <i>Michaelmas Molina</i> being not
a little vain glorious of what he had done with me, in perfecting me in an unknowne
tongue in so short a space, which was very little above one quarter of the yeer, writ unto
the Provinciall acquainting him of what paines he had taken with me, and of the
good successe of his endeavours, assuring him that I was now fit to take a charge of
<i>Indians</i> upon me, and to preach alone, further desiring him that he would bestow upon
me some <i>Indian</i> Towne and Benefice where I might by constant preaching practice
and further that which with so much facility I had learned. The Provinciall
(who had alwaies been my friend) needed not spurs to stir him up to shew more and
more his love and kindnesse unto me; but immediately sent me order to goe unto the
two Townes of <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>, and to take charge of the <i>Indians</i> in them, and to
give quarterly an account of what I received thence unto the Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>,
unto which all that valley did appertaine. All the <i>Indian</i> Townes and the Friers that
live in them are subordinate unto some Cloister; and the Friers are called by their Superiours
to give up for the Cloisters use what monies they have spared, after their own
and their servants lawfull maintenance. Which Order yet in <i>Peru</i> is not observed,
for there the Friers who are once beneficed in <i>Indian</i> Towns, depend not upon any
Cloister, but keep all that they get for themselves, and so receive not from their Cloisters
any clothing, or help for their provision, neither give they any account to their
Superiours, but keep, clothe and maintain themselves, with what offerings and other
duties fall unto them from the <i>Indians</i>; which is the cause that the Friers of <i>Peru</i> are
the richest in all the <i>India's</i>, and live not like Friers but rather like Lords, and game and
Dice publikely without controul. But the Friers of <i>Guatemala, Guaxaca</i>, and <i>Mexico</i>,
though they have enough and more then is well sutable to their vow and profession
of poverty, yet they enjoy not the liberty of the <i>Peruan</i> Friers in their <i>Indian</i> Benefices;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
for what is over and above their expences, they give to their Superiours, and from them
they receive every month a jar of wine, of an Arrobe and a halfe, and every yeer a
new habit with other clothing. Yet with what I have said I must not excuse the Friers
of <i>Guatemala</i> from liberty, and the enjoyment of wealth and riches; for they also
game and sport, and spend, and fill their bags, and where in their accounts and reckonings
to the Cloisters they might well give up in a yeer five hundred Crownes besides
their own expences, they give up peradventure three hundred, and usurpe the rest for
themselves, and their vain and idle uses; and trade and traffique under hand with Merchants
against their vow of poverty.</p>

<p>With this subordination therefore (which I have shewed) unto the Prior and Cloister
of <i>Guatemala</i>, I was sent to preach unto the <i>Indians</i> of <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>, from whence
for my sake was removed an old Frier of almost fourscore yeers of age, and called to
his Cloister to rest, who was not able to performe the charge which lay upon him of
two Townes, three leagues distant one from another. The setled means for maintenance
which I enjoyed in these Townes, and the common offerings and duties which
I received from the <i>Indians</i> was this. In <i>Mixco</i> I was allowed every moneth twenty
Crownes, and in <i>Pinola</i> fifteen, which was punctually payed by the Alcaldes and
Regidores, Maiors and Jurates, before the end of the moneth; for which payment,
the Townes sowed a common peece of land with Wheat or Maiz, and kept their book
of accounts, wherein they set downe what crops they yeerly received, what monies
they tooke in for the sale of their Corne, and in the same booke I was to write downe
what every moneth I received from them; which booke at the yeers end they were to
present to be examined by some officer appointed thereunto by the Court of <i>Guatemala</i>.
Besides this monthly allowance, I had from the Sodalities of the soules in Purgatory
every week in each Town two Crownes for a Masse; every moneth two Crownes in
<i>Pinola</i> upon the first Sunday of the moneth from the Sodalitie of the Rosary; and in
<i>Mixco</i> likewise every month from three Sodalities of the Rosary of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>,
which were there belonging unto the <i>Indians</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>, and the <i>Black-mores</i>, two
Crownes a peece. Further from two more Sodalities belonging to the <i>Vera Cruz</i>, or
the Crosse of Christ, every moneth two Crownes a peece. And in <i>Mixco</i> from a Sodality
of the <i>Spaniards</i> belonging to <i>St. Nicolas de Tolentino</i>, two Crowns every month.
And from a Sodality of <i>St. Blas</i> in <i>Pinola</i> every moneth two more Crownes; and finally
in <i>Mixco</i> from a Sodality entituled of <i>St. Jacintho</i> every moneth yet two
Crownes; besides some offerings, of either mony, fowles, or candles, upon those daies
whereon these Masses were sung; all which amounted to threescore and nine Crowns
a month, which was surely setled and paid before the end of the moneth. Besides from
what I have formerly said of the Saints statues which doe belong unto the Churches,
and doe there constantly bring both mony, fowles, candles, and other offerings
upon their day, unto the Preist, the yeerly revenues which I had in those two Towns
will appear not to have been small; for in <i>Mixco</i> there were in my time eighteen Saints
Images, and twenty in <i>Pinola</i>; which brought unto me upon their day four Crowns
a peece for Masse and Sermon, and procession, besides fowles, Turkeys and Cacao,
and the offerings before the Saints, which commonly might bee worth at least three
Crowns upon every Saints day, which yeerly amounted to at least two hundred, threescore
and six Crownes. Besides the Sodalities of the Rosary of the Virgin,
(which as I have before said were foure, three in <i>Mixco</i>, and one in <i>Pinola</i>) upon five
severall feasts of the yeer (which are most observed by the Church of <i>Rome</i>) brought
unto me four Crownes, two for the dayes Masse, and two for a Masse the day following,
which they call the Anniversarie for the dead, who had belonged unto those
Sodalities, which besides those daies offerings (which sometimes were more, sometimes
lesse) and the <i>Indians</i> presents of fowles and Cacao, made up yeerly fourscore
Crowns more. Besides this, the two Sodalities of the <i>Vera Cruz</i> upon two feasts of
the Crosse; the one upon the fourteenth of <i>September</i>, the other upon the third of <i>May</i>,
brought four Crownes a peece for the Masse of the day, and the Anniversary Masse
following, and upon every Friday in Lent two Crownes, which in the whole yeer came
to four and fourty Crownes; all which above reckoned, was as a sure rent in those two
Townes. But, should I spend time to reckon up what besides did accidentally fall,
would be tedious. The Christmas offerings in both those two Townes, were worth
to me when I lived there at least fourty Crownes. Thursday and Friday offerings before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Easter day were about a hundred Crownes; all Soules day offerings commonly
worth fourescore Crownes; and Candlemas day offerings commonly forty more.
Besides what was offered upon the Feast of each Town by all the Country which came
in, which in <i>Mixco</i> one yeer was worth unto mee in Candles and money fourescore
Crownes, and in <i>Pinola</i> (as I reckoned it) fifty more. The Communicants (every one
giving a Riall) might make up in both Towns at least a thousand Rials; and the
Confessions in Lent at least a thousand more, besides other offerings of Eggs, Hony, Cacao,
Fowles and Fruits. Every Christening brought two Rials, every Marriage two
Crowns, every ones death two Crowns more at least; and some in my time dyed, who
would leave ten or twelve Crownes for five or six Masses to bee sung for their
soules.</p>

<p>Thus are those fooles taught that by the Preists singing their soules are delivered
from weeping, and from the fire and torments of Purgatory; and thus by singing all the
yeer doe those Fryers charme from the poore <i>Indians</i> and their Sodalities and Saints
an infinite treasure wherewith they inrich themselves and their Cloisters; as may bee
gathered from what I have noted by my owne experience in those two Townes of
<i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>, (which were farre inferiour yet to <i>Petapa</i> and <i>Amatitlan</i> in the
same Valley, and not to bee compared in offerings and other Church duties to many
other Townes about that Country) which yet yeelded unto mee with the offerings
cast into the Chests which stood in the Churches for the souls of Purgatory, and
with what the <i>Indians</i> offered when they came to speake unto mee (for they never
visit the Preist with empty hands) and with what other Masse stipends did casually come
in, the summe of at least two thousand Crownes of <i>Spanish</i> money, which might
yeerly mount to five hundred <i>English</i> pounds. I thought this Benefice might bee a
fitter place for mee to live in, then in the Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>, wearying out my
braines with points of false grounded Divinity for to get onely the applause of the
Scholars of the University, and now and then some small profit; which I thought I
might looke after as well as the rest of my profession, nay with more reason, for that
I intended to return to <i>England</i>, and I knew I should have little help for so long a
journey in leaving there my friends, if so bee that I made not my mony my best friend
to assist mee by Sea and Land. My first indeavour was to certifie my selfe from the
Book of Receipts and Accounts in the Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>, what reckonings my Predecessor
and others before him had given up to the Cloister yeerly from <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>,
that I might regulate my selfe and my expenses so, as to be able to live with credit,
and to get thanks from the Cloister by giving more then any before me had given. I
found that four hundred crowns had been the most that my old Predecessour had given
yeerly in his Accounts; and that before him little more was usually given from those
two Towns; Whereupon I took occasion once in discourse with the Prior of <i>Guatemala</i>
to aske what hee would willingly expect from mee yeerly whilst I lived in those two
Towns; to which he replyed that if I upheld for my part the Cloisters usuall and yeerly
Revenues, giving what my Predecessour had given, he would thanke me, and expect
no more from mee, and that the rest that befell mee in those Towns, I might spend it
in Books, Pictures, Chocolatte, Mules, and Servants; to which I made reply, that
I thought I could live in that Benefice creditably enough, and yet give from it more to the
Cloister then ever any other before mee had given, and that I would forfeit my continuing
there if I gave not to the Cloister every year four hundred and fifty Crowns. The
Prior thanked mee heartily for it, and told mee I should not want for wine, (wishing
mee to send for it every moneth) nor for clothing, which hee would every yeer once
bestow upon me. This I thought would save a great part of my charges, and that I was
well provided for as long as I lived in the <i>India's</i>. And here I desire, that <i>England</i> may
take notice how a Fryer that hath professed to be a Mendicant, being beneficed in <i>America</i>,
may live with foure hundred pounds a yeer cleare, and some with much more, with
most of his cloathing given him besides, and the most charge of his wine supplyed,
with the abundance of Fowles, which cost him nothing, and with such plenty of
Beef, as yeelds him thirteen pound for three pence? Surely well may hee game, buy
good Mules, furnish his chamber with hangings, and rich pictures, and Cabinets, yea
and fill them with <i>Spanish</i> Pistols, and peeces of eight, and after all trade in the Court
of <i>Madrid</i> for a Mitre and fat Bishoprick, which commonly is the end of those proud
worldly and lazy Lubbars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>After I was once setled in these my two Townes, my first care was to provide my
selfe of a good mule, which might soon and easily carry mee (as often as occasion called)
from the one Towne to the other. I soon found out one, which cost mee fourescore
Crownes, which served my turn very well, to ride speedily the nine miles crosse
the Valley, which were between the two Townes. Though my chief study here was
to perfect my selfe in the <i>Indian</i> tongue, that I might the better preach unto them, and
be well understood; yet I omitted not to search out the Scriptures daily, and to addict
my selfe unto the Word of God, which I knew would profit mee more then all
those riches and pleasures of <i>Egypt</i>, which for a while I saw I must enjoy, till my ten yeers
were fully expired, and Licence from <i>Rome</i> or <i>Spain</i> granted for me to return to <i>England</i>,
which I began speedily to sollicite by meanes of one Captain <i>Isidro de Zepeda</i>, a <i>Sevill</i>
Merchant and Master of one of the Ships, which came that first yeer that I was setled
in <i>Mixco</i> with Merchandize for <i>Guatemala</i>; By this Captain (who passed often through
the Valley) I writ unto my friends in <i>Spain</i> and had answers, though at first to little
purpose, which did not a little increase the troubles of my Conscience, which were
great, and such whereof the wise man said, A wounded Conscience who can bear? My
friendship with this Captain <i>Zepeda</i> was such, that I broke my mind unto him, desiring
him to carry mee in his Ship to <i>Spain</i>; which he refused to doe, telling me the danger he
might bee in, if complaint should be made to the President of <i>Guatemala</i>, and wishing me
to continue where I was, &amp; to store my self with mony that I might return with Licence
and credit. I resolved therefore with <i>David</i> in the 16 <i>Psal.</i> and the 8. V. to set the Lord alwayes
before me, and to choose him for my onely comfort, and to relie upon his providence
who I knew only could order things for my good, and could from <i>America</i> bring
me home to the House of Salvation, and to the houshold of Faith; from which I considered
my self an exile, and farre banished. In the mean time I lived five full yeers in
the two Townes of <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>. Where I had more occasion to get wealth
and money, then ever any that lived there before mee; for the first yeer of my abiding
there it pleased God to send one of the plagues of <i>Egipt</i> to that Country, which was
of Locusts, which I had never seen till then. They were after the manner of our
Grashoppers, but somewhat bigger, which did flye about in number so thick and infinite
that they did truly cover the face of the Sun and hinder the shining forth of
the beames of that bright planet. Where they lighted either upon trees or standing
Corn, there nothing was expected but ruine, destruction and barrennesse; for the corn
they devoured, the leaves and fruits of trees they eat and consumed, and hung so thick
upon the branches, that with their weight they tore them from the body. The high waies
were so covered with them that they startled the travelling Mules with their fluttering
about their head and feet; my eyes were often struck with their wings as I rid along,
and much a doe I had to see my way, what with a Montero wherewith I was faine to
cover my face, what with the flight of them which were still before my eyes.</p>

<p>The Farmers towards the South Sea Coast, cryed out for that their Indigo which
was then in grasse, was like to bee eaten up; from the Ingenio's of Sugar, the like
moan was made, that the young and tender Sugar Canes would bee destroyed; but above
all grievous was the outcry of the husbandmen of the Valley where I lived, who
feared that their Corn would in one night be swallowed up by that devouring Legion.
The care of the Magistrate was that the Townes of <i>Indians</i> should all goe out into
the fields with Trumpets, and what other instruments they had to make a noise, and
so to affright them from those places which were most considerable and profitable to
the Common-wealth; and strange it was to see how the loud noise of the <i>Indians</i> and
sounding of the Trumpets, defended some fields from the feare and danger of them.
Where they lighted in the Mountaines and High wayes, there they left behind them
their young ones, which were found creeping upon the ground ready to threaten
with a second yeers plagues if not prevented; wherefore all the Townes were called
with Spades, Mattocks and Shovels to dig long Trenches and therein to bury all the
young ones.</p>

<p>Thus with much trouble to the poore <i>Indians</i>, and their great paines (yet after
much hurt and losse in many places) was that flying Pestilence chased away out of the
Country to the South Sea, where it was thought to bee consumed by the Ocean, and
to have found a grave in the waters, whilst the young ones found it in the Land.
Yet they were not all so buried, but that shortly some appeared, which not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
so many in number as before were with the former diligence soon overcome.
But whilst all this feare was, these outcries were made by the Country and
this diligence performed by the <i>Indians</i>, the Preists got well by it; for every
where Processions were made, and Masses sung for the averting of that Plague.
In <i>Mixco</i> most of the idols were carryed to the field, especially the pictures
of our Lady, and that of St. <i>Nicolas Tolentine</i>, in whose name the Church of
<i>Rome</i> doth use to blesse little Breads and Wafers with the Saint stamped upon them;
which they think are able to defend them from Agues, Plague, Pestilence, Contagion,
or any other great and imminent danger. There was scarce any <i>Spanish</i> Husbandman
who in this occasion came not from the Valley to the Town of <i>Mixco</i> with his offering
to this Saint, and who made not a vow to have a Masse sung unto Saint <i>Nicolas</i>; they
all brought breads to bee blessed, and carryed them back to their Farmes, some casting
them into their Corn, some burying them in their hedges and fences, strongly trusting
in Saint <i>Nicolas</i>, that his bread would have power to keepe the Locust out of
their fields; and so at the last those simple, ignorant, and blinded soules, when they
saw the Locusts departed and their Corn safe, cried out to our Lady some, others to
Saint <i>Nicolas</i>, Milagro, a Miracle, Judging the Saint worthy of praise more then God,
and performing to him their vows of Masses, which in their feare and trouble they
had vowed, by which erroneous and idolatrous devotion of theirs I got that yeer many
more Crownes then what before I have numbred from the Sodalities. The next
yeere following, all that country was generally infected with a kinde of contagious
sicknesse, almost as infectious as the Plague, which they call Tabardillo, and was a Feaver
in the very inward parts and bowels, which scarce continued to the seventh day,
but commonly tooke them away from the world to a grave the the third or fifth day.
The filthy smell and stench which came from them, which lay sick of this disease was
enough to infect the rest of the house, and all that came to see them; It rotted their
very mouths and tongues, and made them as black as a coal before they died. Very
few <i>Spaniards</i> were infected with this Contagion, but the <i>Indians</i> generally were taken
with it. It was reported to have begun about <i>Mexico</i>, and to have spread from
Town to Town, till it came to <i>Guatemala</i>, and went on forwards; and so likewise did
the Locusts the yeer before, marching as it were from <i>Mexico</i> over all the Country. I
visited many that died of this infection, using no other Antidote against it, save onely
a handkercheif dipped in Vineger to smell unto, and I thanke God I escaped where
many dyed. In <i>Mixco</i>, I buried ninety young and old, and in <i>Pinola</i> above an hundred;
and for all these that were eight yeere old, or upwards, I received two Crownes for a
Masse for their soules delivery out of Purgatory. See good Reader, whether the conceit
of Purgatory have not been a maine policy of <i>Rome</i> to enrich the Preist and Clergy,
with Masse stipends from such as die, making them beleeve that nothing else can helpe
their soules if once plunged into that conceited fire; Where thou maist see that one contagious
sicknesse in two small Townes of <i>Indians</i> brought unto me in lesse then half a
yeer neere a hundred pounds for Masses, for almost two hundred that died. Nay such
is the greedy covetousnesse of those Preists, that they will receive three or four Masse
stipends for one day, making the people beleeve that the same Masse may bee offered up
for many, and doe one soule as much good as another. Thus with the Plague of Locusts,
and the contagion of sicknesse, for the first two yeers together had I an occasion
to enrich my self, as did other Preists my neighbours. But think not that because so
many died, therefore the Towns growing lesse my offerings for the future were lessened.
The Encomendero's or Lords of the two Towns took care for that, who, that
they might not lose any part of that Tribute which was formerly paid unto them,
presently after the sicknesse was ceased, caused them to bee numbred, and (as I have in
the Chapter before observed) forced to marriage all that were twelve yeers and upwards
of age; which also was a new streame of Crownes flowing into my bagges; for
from every couple that were married I had also two Crownes besides other offerings,
and in both the Towns, I married in that occasion above fourescore Couple. Truly
by all this, I thank the Lord, I was more strengthened in my conceit against the Church
of <i>Rome</i>, and not with that greedinesse of that Lucre intised to continue in it, though
I found the preferments there farre greater then any might bee in the Church of <i>England</i>,
where I knew nothing was to bee got with singing, or hudling over a Masse;
But yet though for the present my profit was great, my eyes were open to see the errours
whereby that profit came so plentifully to mee, and to all that crew of Idolatrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Preists; The judgments ceased not here in that Country in my time; but after
this contagion there was such an Inundation of rain that the husbandmen feared again
the losse of all their Corn. At noone time the darke clouds for a month together began
to thicken and cover the face of the heavens, powring down such stormy showres
as swept away much Corn, and many poore Cottages of <i>Indians</i>; besides the raine,
the fiery thunder bolts breaking through the clouds threatned a dolefull judgement
to all the Country. In the Valley of <i>Mixco</i> two riding together were stricken dead
from their Mules, the Chappel of our Lady of <i>Carmel</i> in the same valley was burnt
to the ground, and likewise two houses at the river of <i>Vaccas</i>. In <i>Petapa</i> another flash
of lightning, or thunderbolt fell into the Church upon the high Altar, cracking the
walls in many places, running from Altar to Altar, defacing all the gold, and leaving
a print and stamp where it had gone without any more hurt. In the Cloister of
the Franciscans in <i>Guatemala</i>, a Frier sleeping upon his bed after dinner, was stricken
dead, his body being left all blacke as if it had been burnt with fire, and yet no signe
of any wound about him. Many accidents happened that yeer which was 1632. all
about the Countrey. But my selfe was by the safe protection of the Almighty wonderfully
saved; for being on a Saturday at night in <i>Mixco</i> trembling and fearing, and
yet trusting in my God, and praying unto him in my chamber, one flash of lightning
or thunderbolt fell close to the Church wall to which my chamber joyned, and
killed two Calves, which were tied to a post in a yard, to be slaughtered the next morning.
The lightning was so neer and terrible that it seemed to have fired all my house,
and strucke me downe unto the ground, where I lay as dead for a great while; when I
came again to my self, I heard many <i>Indians</i> about my house, who were come to see if
either it or the Church were set on fire. This stormy season brought me also much
profit, for (as formerly) the <i>Spaniards</i> of the valley and the <i>Indians</i> betooke themselves
to their Idol Saints carrying them about in procession, which was not done
without mony, which they call their almes unto their Saints, that they may the better
be heard and intreated by them.</p>

<p>The summer following there was more then the ordinary earthquakes, which
were so great that yeer in the Kingdome of <i>Peru</i>, that a whole City called <i>Truxillo</i>
was swallowed up by the earth which opened it selfe, and almost all the people were
lost, whilst they were at Church worshiping and praying unto their Saints. The hurt
they did about <i>Guatemala</i> was not so much as in other places, only some few mud
walls were shaken downe, and some Churches cracked; which made the people fear
and betake themselves again to their Saints, and empty their purses before them for
Masses and processions, lest the danger should prove as great, as was that of the great
earthquake which happened before my coming into that Country. These earthquakes
when they begin are more often, then long, for they last but for a while, stirring the
earth with three motions, first on the one side, then on the other, and with the third
motion they seem to set it right againe. If they should continue, they would doubtlesse
hurle downe to the ground any steeple or building though never so great, and
strong. Yet at this time in <i>Mixco</i> some were so violent, that they made the steeple
bend so much that they made the bells sound. I was so used unto them that many times
in my bed I would not stir for them. Yet this yeer they brought me to such a feare,
that had not the Lord been a present refuge to me in time of trouble I had utterly been
undone. For being one morning in my chamber studying, so great and suddain was
an earthquake, that it made me run from my table to a window, fearing that before I
could get down the staires, the whole house might fall upon my head, the window
was in a thicke wall vaulted upwards like an arch (which the <i>Spaniards</i> hold to be the
safest place if a house should fall) where I expected nothing but death; as soon as I
got under it, the earthquake ceased, though my heart ceased not to quake with the
suddain affrightment. Whilst I was musing and thinking what to doe, whether I
should run downe to the yard, or continue where I was, there came a second shaking
worse then the first. I thought with my selfe if the house should fall, the Arch would
not save my life, and that I should either be stifled or throwne out of the window,
which was not very low and neer unto the ground, but somewhat high wide open,
having no glasse casements but woodden shuts, (such as there are used) and if I leaped
out of the window, I might chance to breake a leg, or a limbe, yet save my life. The
suddainnesss of the astonishment tooke from me the best and most mature deliberation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
in such a case; and in the midst of these my troubled and perplexed thoughts a third motion
came as violent as the former, wherewith I had now set one foot in the window to
leap down, had not the same Lord (to whom <i>David</i> said in the 46 <i>Ps.</i> v. 2. Therefore will
not wee feare, though the earth bee moved) by his wonderfull providence spoken
both to mee and to the moving earth, saying as in the 10. Verse, Bee still and know
that am I God; for certainly had it gone on to a fourth motion, I had by casting down
my self broke either my neck, or a legge, or some other joynt. Thus was I twice saved
by my good God in <i>Mixco</i>, and in <i>Pinola</i> I was once no lesse in danger in losing a leg
by means of a smaller instrument then is a flea.</p>

<p>This Towne of <i>Pinola</i> in the <i>Indian</i> language is called <i>Panac; Pan</i>, signifieth in, or
amongst, <i>Cac</i>, signifieth three thinges; for it signifieth the fire, or a fruit otherwise
called <i>guiava</i>; or thirdly, a small vermine, commonly called by the <i>Spaniards,
Nigua</i>; which is common over all the <i>India's</i>, but more in some places then in others.
Where there are many hogs, there is usually much of this sort of vermine. The <i>Spaniards</i>
report that many of the Souldiers of <i>Sir Francis Drake</i> died of them, when
they landed about <i>Nombre de Dios</i>, and marched up the high Mountaines of St. <i>Pablo</i>
towards <i>Panama</i>, who feeling their feet to itch, and not knowing the cause thereof,
scratched them so much, till they festred, and at last, (if this report be true) cost them
their lives. Some say, they breed in all places, high and low, upon Tables, Beds, and
upon the ground; but experience sheweth the contrary, that they onely breed upon
the ground, for where the houses are sluttish, and not often swept, there commonly
they are most felt; and in that they usually get into the Feet and Shooes, and seldome
into the hands or any other part of the body, argues that they breed upon the ground.
They are lesse then the least Flea, and can scarce bee perceived, and when they enter into
the Foot, they make it burn and itch; and if then they bee looked to, they appeare
black, and no bigger then the point of a pin, and with a pin may easily bee taken out
whole; but if part of them bee left, the smallest part will doe as much harm
as the whole, and will get into the flesh. When once they are got in, they breed a
little bagge in the flesh, and in it a great many Nits, which increase bigger and bigger to
the bignesse of a great Pea; then they begin again to make the Foot itch, which if it be
scratched, falleth to festering, and so indangereth the whole Foot. Some hold it best
to take them out when they cause the first itching and are getting in; but this is hard
to doe, because they can hardly then bee perceived, and they are apt to bee broken.
Therefore others commonly let them alone, untill they bee got into the flesh, and have
bred a bag with nits, which like a blister sheweth it self through the skinne, and then
with the point of a pin, they dig round about the bag, till they can with the pins point
take it out whole, if it bee broken, it comes to breed againe; if it bee taken out whole,
then they put in a little Eare wax, or ashes where the bag lay, and with that the hole is
healed up againe in a day or two. The way to avoid this vermines entering into the
foot, is to lay both shoos and stockings, or whatsoever other clothing upon some stool or
chair high from the ground, and not to go bare-foot; which yet is wonderfull in the <i>Indians</i>
themselves, that though they commonly doe goe barefoot, yet they are seldome
troubled with them, which is attributed to the hardnesse of their skin; for certainly
were they as tender footed and skinned as are those that wear both shoos and stockins,
they would be as much troubled with them as these are. <i>Panac</i> or <i>Pinola</i>, is much subject
to this Vermin, or <i>Nigua</i>, and I found it by wofull experience, for at my first comming
thither not knowing well the quality of it, I let one breed so long in my foot, and continued
scratching it, untill my foot came to be so festered, that I was fain to lie two whole
months in a Chirurgions hand, and at last through Gods great mercy and goodnesse to
me I lost not a Limbe. But that the Providence of God may be known to me the worst of
all his Creatures, living in so farre a Country from all my friends, and from me may be
related unto future Generations, before I conclude this Chapter, I shall further shew
both my dangers and deliverances. Though true it is, most of the <i>Indians</i> are but formally
Christians, and onely outwardly appear such, but secretly are given to witchcraft
and idolatry, yet as they were under my charge, I thought by preaching Christ unto
them, and by cherishing them, and defending them from the cruelty of the <i>Spaniards</i>, I
might better worke upon them to bring them to more knowledge of some truths, at
least concerning God and Christ. Therefore as I found them truely loving, kind and
bountifull unto mee, so I indeavoured in all occasions to shew them love by commiserating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
their sufferings, and taking their part against any <i>Spaniard</i> that wronged them, and
keeping constantly in my Chamber such drugs (as hot Waters, Anniseed and wine and
the like) which I knew might most please them, when they came to see mee, and most
comfort them, when they were sick or grieved. This my love and pity towards them
had almost in <i>Pinola</i> cost mee my life; For an <i>Indian</i> of that Town serving a <i>Spaniard</i>
named <i>Francisco de Montenegro</i> (who lived a mile and a half from thence) was once so
pittifully beaten and wounded by his Master, for that hee told him hee would complain
to mee that hee payed him not his wages, that he was brought home to the Town,
and had I not out of my charity called for a Chirurgion from <i>Petapa</i> to cure him, he
had certainly dyed. I could not but complain for the poor <i>Indian</i> unto the President
of <i>Guatemala</i>, who respecting my complaint, sent for my <i>Spaniard</i> to the City, imprisoned
him, and kept him close untill the <i>Indian</i> was recovered, and so with a Fine
sent him back againe. In a Sermon further I pressed this home unto the neighbouring
<i>Spaniards</i>, warning them of the wrongs &amp; abuses which they offered unto the poor <i>Indians</i>,
which I told them I would put up no more then any injury done unto my self, for
that I looked upon them as Neophytes and new plants of Christianity, who were not
to be discouraged, but by all means of love incouraged to come to Christ; withall I commanded
all the <i>Indians</i> that had any wrong done unto them, to come unto mee, assuring
them that I would make such a complaint for them as should bee heard, as they
might perceive I had lately done to some purpose. This Sermon stuck so in <i>Montenegro</i>
his stomack, that (as I was informed) hee made an Oath, that hee would procure my
death. Though it was told mee; yet I could hardly beleeve it, judging it to be more
a bravery and a vaine boasting of a <i>Spaniard</i>, then anything else; Yet by the advice of
some friends I was counselled to looke to my selfe, which yet I slighted, untill one
day the boyes and <i>Indians</i> that served in my house came running to my chamber door,
wishing mee to look to my selfe, and not to come out, for that <i>Montenegro</i> was come
into my Yard with a naked sword to kill mee. I charged them from within to call
the Officers of the Towne to aid and assist mee; but in the mean while my furious
<i>Spaniard</i> perceiving himselfe discovered left the Town. With this I thought of securing
of my self better, and called for a Blackmore <i>Miguel Dalva</i> a very stout and lusty
fellow who lived from mee halfe a mile, to bee about mee untill I could discover more
of <i>Montenegroes</i> designes and malicious intents. The next Sabbath Day in the morning
being to ride to the Town of <i>Mixco</i>, I carried my Blackmore, and half a dozen
of <i>Indians</i> in my company, and going through a little wood in the midst of the Valley,
there I found my enemy waiting for mee, who seeing the train I brought, durst
doe nothing, but gave mee spightfull languages, telling mee hee hoped that hee should
finde mee alone some time or other. With this I thought fit to delay no longer my second
complaint to the President against him, who as before heard mee willingly, and
after a moneths imprisonment banished <i>Montenegro</i> thirty leagues from the Valley. And
not onely from <i>Spaniards</i> was I in danger for the <i>Indians</i> sake whilst I lived in those
Townes; but also from some <i>Indians</i> themselves, (who were false in Religion) I did
undergoe great perils, and yet was still delivered.</p>

<p>In <i>Pinola</i> there were some, who were much given to witchcraft, and by the power of
the Devill did act strange things. Amongst the rest there was one old woman named
<i>Martha de Carrillo</i>, who had been by some of the Town formerly accused for bewitching
many; but the <i>Spanish</i> Justices quitted her, finding no sure evidence against her; with this
she grew worse and worse, and did much harm. When I was there, two or three dyed, withering
away, declaring at their death that this <i>Carrillo</i> had killed them, &amp; that they saw
her often about their beds, threatning them with a frowning and angry look. The <i>Indians</i>
for feare of her durst not complain against her, nor meddle with her; whereupon I
sent word unto <i>Don Juan de Guzman</i> the Lord of that Town, that if hee tooke not order
with her, she would destroy his Town. He hearing of it, got for mee a Commission from
the Bishop and another officer of the Inquisition to make diligent &amp; private inquiry after
her life and actions; which I did, and found among the <i>Indians</i> many and grievous complaints
against her, most of the town affirming that certainly she was a notorious witch,
and that before her former accusation shee was wont whither soever shee went about
the Town to goe with a Duck following her, which when shee came to the Church,
would stay at the doore till shee came out again, and then would return home with her,
which Duck they imagined was her beloved Devill, and familiar Spirit, for that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
had often set dogs at her and they would not meddle with her, but rather run away
from her. This Duck never appeared more with her, since she was formerly accused before
the Justice, which was thought to be her policy, that she might be no more suspected
thereby. This old woman was a widow, and of the poorest of the Town in outward
shew, and yet she alwaies had store of mony, which none could tel which way she might
come by it. Whilst I was thus taking privy information against her (it being the time of
Lent, when all the Town came to Confession) she among the rest came to the Church
to confesse her sins, and brought me the best present and offering of all the Towne, for
whereas a Riall is common she brought me four, and besides a Turkey, egs, fish, and
a little bottle of hony. She thought thereby to get with me a better opinion then I
had of her from the whole Towne; I accepted of her great offering, and heard her
Confession, which was of nothing but trifles, which could scarce be judged sinfull
actions. I examined her very close of what was the common judgement of all the
<i>Indians</i>, and especially of those who dying had declared to my selfe at their death that
she had bewitched them, and before their sicknesse had threatned them, and in their
sicknes appeared threatning them with death about their beds, none but they themselves
seeing her. To which she replyed weeping, that she was wronged; I asked her, how she
being a poore widow without any sons to helpe her, without any meanes of livelyhood
had so much mony, as to give me more then the richest of the Town, how she
came by that fish, Turkey, and hony, having none of this of her owne about her
house? to which she replyed, that God loved her and gave her all these things, and
that with her mony she had bought the rest. I asked her of whom? she answered that
out of the Towne she had them. I perswaded her much to repentance, and to forsake
the Devill and all fellowship with him; but her words and answers were of a
Saintly and holy woman; and she earnestly desired me to give her the Communion
with the rest that were to receive the next day. Which I told her I durst not doe, using
Christs words, Give not the childrens bread unto dogs, nor cast your pearls unto swine;
and that it would be a great scandall to give the Communion unto her, who was suspected
generally, and had been accused for a witch. This she took very ill telling me that
she had many yeers received the Communion, and now in her old age it grieved her
to be deprived of it; her teares were many, yet I could not be moved with them, but
resolutely denied her the Communion, and so dismissed her. At noone when I had
done my worke in the Church, I bad my servants goe to gather up the offerings, and
gave order to have the fish dressed for my dinner which she had brought; but no sooner
was it carried into the Kitchin, when the Cook looking on it found it full of maggots,
and stinking, so that I was forced to hurle it away. With that I began to suspect
my old witch, and went to looke on her hony, and powring it out into a dish, I
found it full of wormes, her egs I could not know from others, there being neer a
hundred offered that day; but after as I used them, we found some rotten, some with
dead chickens within; the next morning the Turkey was found dead; as for her four
Rials, I could not perceive whether she had bewitched them out of my pocket, for that I
had put them with many other, which that day had been given me, yet as far as I could,
I called to memory who and what had been given me, and in my judgement and reckoning
I verily thought that I missed four Rials. At night when my servants the <i>Indians</i>
were gone to bed, I sate up late in my chamber betaking my selfe to my bookes and
study, for I was the next morning to make an exhortation to those that received the
Communion. After I had studyed a while, it being between ten and eleven of the
clock, on a suddain the chief door in the hall (where in a lower roome was my chamber,
and the servants, and three other doores) flew open, and I heard one come in,
and for a while walke about; then was another doore opened which went into a little
room, where my saddles were laid; with this I thought it might be the Black-more
<i>Miguel Dalva</i>, who would often come late to my house to lodge there, especially since
my fear of <i>Montenegro</i>, and I conjectured that he was laying up his saddle, I called unto
him by his name two or three times from within my chamber, but no answer was
made; but suddainly another door that went out to a garden flew also open, wherewith
I began within to feare, my joynts trembled, my haire stood up, I would have called
out to the servants, and my voice was as it were stopped with the sudden affrightment,
I began to thinke of the witch, and put my trust in God against her, and encouraged
my selfe and voice calling out to the servants, and knocking with a cane at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
my doore within that they might heare me, for I durst not open it and goe out. With
the noise which I made the servants awaked and came out to my chamber doore; then
I opened it, and asked them if they had not heard some body in the hall, and all the
doores opened. They said they were asleep, and heard nothing, onely one boy said
he heard all, and related unto me the same that I had heard. I tooke my candle then
in my hand and went out into the hall with them to view the doors, and I found them
all shut, as the servants said they had left them. Then I perceived that the witch would
have affrighted me, but had no power to doe me any harme; I made two of the servants
lie in my chamber, and went to bed. In the morning early I sent for my <i>Fiscal</i>
the Clerk of the Church, and told him what had happened that night; he smiled
upon me, and told me it was the widow <i>Carillo</i>, who had often played such tricks in the
Town with those that had offended her, and therefore he had the night before come
unto me from her desiring me to give her the Communion, lest she should doe me some
hurt, which I denied unto him, as I had done to her selfe. The Clerk bad me be of good
cheere, for he knew she had no power over me to do me any hurt. After the Communion
that day some of the chief <i>Indians</i> came unto me, and told me that old <i>Carillo</i> had
boasted that she would play me some trick or other, because I would not give her the
Communion. But I to rid the Towne of such a limbe of Satan, sent her to <i>Guatemala</i>,
with all the evidences and witnesses which I had found against her unto the
President and Bishop, who commanded her to be put in prison, where she died within
two months.</p>

<p>Many more <i>Indians</i> there were in that Town, who were said in my time to doe very
strange things. One called <i>John Gonzalez</i> was reported to change himselfe into the
shape of a Lion, and in that shape was one day shot in the nose by a poore harmelesse
<i>Spaniard</i> who chiefly got his living by going about the woods and mountaines, and
shooting at wild Deer and other beasts to make mony of them. He espied one day a
Lion, and having no other ayme at him but his snout behind a tree, he shot at him;
the Lion run away; the same day this <i>Gonzalez</i> was taken sick, I was sent for to
hear his Confession, I saw his face and nose all bruised, and asked him how it came,
he told me then that he had fallen from a tree and almost killed himself; yet afterwards
he accused the poore <i>Spaniard</i> for shooting at him; the businesse was examined by a
<i>Spanish</i> Justice, my evidence was taken for what <i>Gonzalez</i> told me of his fall from a
tree, the <i>Spaniard</i> was put to his oath, who sware that he shot at a Lion in a thicke
wood, where an <i>Indian</i> could scarce be thought to have any businesse, the tree was
found out in the wood, whereat the shot had been made and was still marked with the
shot and bullet; which <i>Gonzalez</i> confessed was to be the place; and was examined how he
neither fell nor was seen by the <i>Spaniard</i>, when he came to seeke for the Lion thinking
he had killed him; to which he answered that he ran away lest the <i>Spaniard</i> should
kill him indeed. But his answers seeming frivolous, the <i>Spaniards</i> integrity being
known, and the great suspicion that was in the Town of <i>Gonzalez</i> his dealing with the
Devill, cleared the <i>Spaniard</i> from what was laid against him.</p>

<p>But this was nothing to what after happened to one <i>John Gomez</i>, the chiefest <i>Indian</i>
of that Towne of neer fourscore yeers of age, the Head and Ruler of the principallest
Tribe among the <i>Indians</i>, whose advise and counsell was taken and preferred before all
the rest, who seemed to be a very godly <i>Indian</i>, and very seldome missed morning and
evening prayers in the Church, and had bestowed great riches there. This <i>Indian</i> very
suddainly was taken sick (I being then in my other Town of <i>Mixco</i>) the <i>Mayordomos</i>,
or stewards of the Sodality of the Virgin fearing that he might die without Confession
and they be chid for their negligence, at midnight called me up at <i>Mixco</i>, desiring me
to goe presently and helpe <i>John Gomez</i> to die, whom also they said desired much to see
me and to receive some comfort from me. I judging it a work of charity, although
the time of the night were unseasonable, and the great rain at the present might have
stopped my charity, yet I would not be hindred by either of them, and so set forth to
ride nine miles both in the dark and wet. When I came to <i>Pinola</i> being thorow wet to
the skin, I went immediately to the house of old sick <i>Gomez</i>, who lay with his face all
muffled up, thanked me for my pains and care I had for his soul; he desired to confesse;
and by his confession and weeping evidenced nothing but a godly life, and a willing
desire to die and to be with Christ. I comforted him and prepared him for death, and
before I departed, asked him how he felt himselfe; he answered that his sicknesse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
nothing but old age, and weaknesse. With this I went to my house, changed my self
and lay downe a while to rest, when suddainly I was called up again to give <i>Gomez</i> the
extream unction, which the <i>Indians</i> (as they have been ignorantly taught) will not
omit to receive before they die. As I anointed him in his nose, his lips, his eyes, his
hands and his feet, I perceived that he was swelled, and black and blew; but made nothing
of it, judging it to proceed from the sicknesse of his body; I went again home
being now breake of the day, when after I had taken a small nap, some <i>Indians</i> come
to my doore for to buy candles to offer up for <i>John Gomez</i> his soule, whom they
told me was departed, and was that day to be buried very solemnly at Masse. I arose
with drousie eyes after so unquiet a nights rest; and walked to the Church, where I
saw the grave was preparing. I met with two or three <i>Spaniards</i> who lived neer the
Towne and were come to Masse that morning, who went in with me to my chamber,
and with them I fell into discourse about <i>John Gomez</i>, telling them what comfort I
had received at his death, whom I judged to have lived very holily, and doubted not
of his salvation, and that the Towne would much want him, for that hee was their
chief guide, and leader, ruling them with good advise and counsell. At this the
<i>Spaniards</i> smiled one at another, and told me I was much deceived by all the <i>Indians</i>,
but especially by the deceased <i>Gomez</i>, if I judged him to have been a Saint, and holy
man. I told them that they as enemies to the poore <i>Indians</i> judged still uncharitably
of them; but that I who knew very well their consciences, could judge better of them
then they. One then replyed, that it seemed I little knew the truth of <i>John Gomez</i> his
death by the Confession which he had made unto me, and that I seemed to be ignorant
of the stir which was in the Towne concerning his death. This seemed so strange unto
me, that I desired them to informe me of the truth. Then they told me that the report
went, that <i>John Gomez</i> was the chief wizard of all the wizards and witches in the
Town, and that commonly he was wont to be changed into the shape of a Lion, and
so to walke about the mountaines. That he was ever a deadly enemie to one <i>Sebastian
Lopez</i> an ancient <i>Indian</i>, and head of another Tribe; and that both of them two
daies before had met in the mountaine, <i>Gomez</i> in the shape of a Lion, and <i>Lopez</i> in
the shape of a Tigre, and that they fought most cruelly, till <i>Gomez</i> (who was the older,
and weaker) was tired, much bit and bruised; and died of it. And further that
I might be assured of this truth, they told me that <i>Lopez</i> was in prison for it, and the
two Tribes striving about it; and that the Tribe and kindred of <i>Gomez</i> demanded from
<i>Lopez</i> and his Tribe and kindred satisfaction, and a great sum of mony, or els did threaten
to make the case known unto the <i>Spanish</i> power and authority, which yet they were
unwilling to doe if they could agree and smother it up among themselves, that they
might not bring an aspersion upon their whole Towne. This seemed very strange unto
me, and I could not resolve what to beleeve, and thought I would never more beleeve
an <i>Indian</i>, if I found <i>John Gomez</i> to have so much dissembled and deceived me.
I tooke my leave of the <i>Spaniards</i> and went my selfe to the prison, where I found <i>Lopez</i>
with fetters. I called one of the officers of the Towne, who was Alguazil Maior,
and my great friend, unto my house, and privately examined him why <i>Lopez</i> was
kept so close prisoner; he was loth to tell me fearing the rest of the <i>Indians</i>, and hoping
the businesse would be taken up and agreed by the two Tribes, and not noised about
the Country which at that very instant the two Alcaldes and Regidores, Maiors and
Jurates, with the chiefe of both Tribes were sitting about in the Towne-house all
that morning. But I seeing the officer so timorous, was more desirous to know something,
and pressed more upon him for the truth, giving him an inkling of what I had
heard from the <i>Spaniards</i> before. To which he answered that if they could agree amongst
themselves, they feared no ill report from the <i>Spaniards</i> against their Towne; I
told him I must know what they were agreeing upon amongst themselves so closely in
the Towne-house. He told me, if I would promise him to say nothing of him (for
he feared the whole Towne if they should know he had revealed any thing unto mee)
he would tel me the truth. With this I comforted him, and gave him a cup of wine, and
encouraged him, warranting him that no harm should come unto him for what he told
me. Then he related the businesse unto me as the <i>Spaniards</i> had done, and told me that
he thought the Tribes amongst themselves would not agree, for that some of <i>Gomez</i>
his friends hated <i>Lopez</i> and all such as were so familiar with the Devill, and cared not
if <i>Gomez</i> his dissembling life were laid open to the world; but others he said, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
were as bad as <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Gomez</i>, would have it kept close, lest they and all the witches
and Wizards of the Town should bee discovered. This struck mee to the very
heart, to think that I should live among such people, whom I saw were spending all
they could get by their worke and labour upon the Church, Saints and in offerings, and
yet were so privy to the counsels of Satan; it grieved mee that the Word I preached
unto them, did no more good, and I resolved from that time forward to spend most
of my indeavours against Satans subtility, and to shew them more then I had done, the
great danger of their soules who had made any compact with the Devill, that I might
make them abandon and abjure his workes, and close with Christ by Faith. I dismissed
the <i>Indian</i>, and went to the Church, to see if the people were come to Masse;
I found there no body but onely two who were making <i>Gomez</i> his Grave. I went
back to my Chamber, troubled much within my self, whether I should allow him a
Christian Buriall, who had lived and died so wickedly, as I had been informed. Yet
I thought I was not bound to beleeve one <i>Indian</i> against him, nor the <i>Spaniards</i> whom
I supposed spoke but by hearsay. Whilst I was thus musing, there came unto mee at least
twenty of the chiefest of the Town with the two Majors, Jurates, and all the Officers of
Justice, who desired mee to forbeare that day the burying of <i>John Gomez</i>, for that
they had resolved to call a Crowne Officer to view his Corps and examine his death,
lest they all should bee troubled for him, and hee againe unburied. I made as if I
knew nothing, but inquired of them the reason; then they related all unto me, and told
me how there were witnesses in the Town who saw a Lyon and a Tyger fighting, and
presently lost the sight of the beasts, and saw <i>John Gomez</i>, and <i>Sebastian Lopez</i>, much
about the same place parting one from another; and that immediately <i>John Gomez</i> came
home bruised to his bed, from whence he never rise more, and that he declared upon his
death-bed unto some of his friends that <i>Sebastian Lopez</i> had killed him; whereupon
they had him in safe custody. Further they told me that though they had never known
so much wickednesse of these two chief heads of their Towne whom they had much
respected and followed, yet now upon this occasion, from the one Tribe and the other
they were certainly informed that both of them did constantly deale with the Devill,
which would bee a great aspersion upon their Town, but they for their parts abjured
all such wicked wayes, and prayed me not to conceive the worse of all for a few, whom
they were resolved to persecute, and suffer not to live amongst them. I told them I
much liked their good zeal, and incouraged them as good Christians to indeavour the
rooting out of Satan from their Towne, and they did very well in giving notice to
<i>Guatemala</i>, to the <i>Spanish</i> power, of this accident, and that if they had concealed it,
they might all have been punished as guilty of <i>Gomez</i> his death, and Agents with Satan,
and his instruments. I assured them I had no ill conceipt of them, but rather judged well
of them for what they were agreed to doe. The Crowne Officer was sent for who
came that night and searched <i>Gomez</i> his body; I was present with him, and found it
all bruised, scratched, and in many places bitten and sore wounded. Many evidences
and suspitions were brought in against <i>Lopez</i> by the <i>Indians</i> of the Town, especiall
by <i>Gomez</i> his friends, whereupon hee was carryed away to <i>Guatemala</i>, and there
againe was tryed by the same witnesses, and not much denying the fact himself, was
there hanged. And <i>Gomez</i>, though his grave was opened in the Church, hee was not
buried in it, but in another made ready for him in a Ditch.</p>

<p>In <i>Mixco</i> I found also some <i>Indians</i> no lesse dissemblers then was this <i>Gomez</i>, and
those of the chiefest and richest of the Town, who were foure Brothers called <i>Fuentes</i>,
and half a score more. These were outwardly very faire tongued, liberall, and free
handed to the Church; much devoted to the Saints, great feasters upon their day,
and yet in secret great Idolaters. But it pleased God to make mee his instrument,
to discover and bring to light the secrecy of their hidden works of darknesse, which it seems
the privacy of a thick Wood and Mountaine had many yeers hid from the eyes of the
World. Some of these being one day in the company of other better Christians drinking
hard of their <i>Chicha</i>, boasted of their God, saying that hee had preached unto them
better then I could preach, nay that hee had plainly told them that they should not
beleeve any thing that I preached of Christ, but follow the old wayes of their Forefathers,
who worshipped their Gods aright, but now by the example of the <i>Spaniards</i>
they were deluded, and brought to worship a false God. The other Christians hearing
of this began to wonder, and to enquire of them where that God was, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
much ado, promising to follow their ways, and their God, got out of them the place and
Mountain where they might find him. Though this in drunkennes were agreed upon, yet
in sobernes the good Christians thought better of what they had agreed upon, slighted
what before in drinking they heard, and yet it was not kept by them so close, but that it
came to the ears of a <i>Spaniard</i> in the Vally; who finding himself touched in Conscience,
came to <i>Mixco</i> to me, and told me what he had heard, that some <i>Indians</i> of that town followed
an Idol, and boasted that he had preached unto them against my Doctrine, and for
the ways of the former Heathens. I thanked God for that he was pleased to undermine
the secret works of Satan daily; and desired the <i>Spaniard</i> to tell me by whom hee came to
know of this. He told me the <i>Indians</i> name from whom he had it, and that he was afraid
to discover the <i>Indians</i>, and to tell mee of it. I sent for the <i>Indian</i> before the <i>Spaniard</i>,
who confessed unto mee that hee had heard of such a thing; but knew that if hee did
discover the <i>Indians</i>, they with the power of the Devill would doe him much harm;
I told him, if hee were a true Christian, hee ought to fight against the Devill, and not
to feare him, who could do him no harm if God were with him, and he closed by Faith
with Christ, and that the discovery of that Idoll might bee a meanes for the converting
of the Idolaters, when they should see the small power of their false God against the
true God of the Christians. Further I told him plainly, that if hee did not tell mee
who the <i>Indians</i> were, and where their Idol was, that I would have him to <i>Guatemala</i>,
and there make him discover what hee knew. Here the <i>Indian</i> began to tremble, and
told mee the <i>Fuentes</i> had boasted of such an Idol, whom they called their God, and gave
some signes of a Fountaine and of a Pine Tree at the mouth of a Cave in such a Mountaine.
I asked him, if hee knew the place, or what kind of Idol it was; hee told mee,
that hee had often been in that Mountaine, where hee had seen two or three springs of
water, but never was in any Cave. I asked him if he would goe with me, and helpe mee
to find it out, hee refused still fearing the Idolaters, and wished mee not to goe, for fear
if they should bee there, they might kill mee rather then bee discovered. I answered
him that I would carry with mee such a Guard as should bee able to defend mee against
them, and my Faith in the true living God, would secure mee against that false God. I
resolved therefore with the <i>Spaniard</i> to goe to search out the cave the next day, and to
carry with mee three or foure <i>Spaniards</i> and my Blackmore <i>Miguel Dalva</i>, and that
<i>Indian</i>. I told him I would not suffer him to goe home to his house that day, for
feare hee should discover in the Towne my designe and purpose, and so wee might bee
prevented by the Idolaters, who certainly that night would take away their Idol. The
<i>Indian</i> still refused, till I threatned him to send for the Officers of Justice, and to secure
his person; with this hee yeelded, and that hee might have no discourse with any
body in the Town, nor with the Servants of my house, I desired the <i>Spaniard</i> to take
him home to his house, and to keep him there close that day and night, promising
to bee with him the next morning. I charged the <i>Spaniard</i> also with secresie, and so
dismissed him with the <i>Indian</i>. That day I rid to <i>Pinola</i> for the Blackmore <i>Miguel
Dalva</i>, and brought him to <i>Mixco</i> with mee, not telling him what my intent was; I
went also to foure neighbouring <i>Spaniards</i>, desiring them to bee in a readinesse the next
morning to goe a little way with mee for the service of God, and to meet mee at such
a neighbours house, and that if they would bring their Fowling peeces, wee might
chance to find some sport where wee went, and as for Provision of Wine and Meat, I
would provide sufficiently. They promised to goe with mee, thinking that although
I told them, it was for the service of God, my purpose onely was to hunt after some
wild Deere in the mountaines. I was glad they construed my action that way, and so
went home, and provided that night a good Gammon of Bacon, and some Fowles rosted,
cold, and others boiled, well peppered and salted for the next dayes work. Where I had
appointed my <i>Indian</i> to be kept, I met with the rest of my company, and from thence
wee went together to the place of the Idolaters worshipping, which was some six miles
from <i>Mixco</i> towards the Town of St. <i>John Sacatepeques</i>. When wee came into the
Wood wee presently met with a deep Barranca, or bottome, where was a running,
which incouraged us to make there diligent search, but nothing could bee found; from
thence wee ascended up out of the Barranca, and found after much time spent a spring
of water, and looked carefully about it, but could finde no Cave. Thus in vaine wee
searched till the Evening, and fearing lest wee might lose our way and our selves, if
the night overtook us, my friends began to speak of returning homewards. But I considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
that as yet wee had not gone over one half part of the Wood, and to goe home
and come againe might make us to bee noted, and spoken of, wee thought it our best
way to take up our lodging that night in the Wood, and in that bottome which we first
searched, where was good water for to drinke Chocolatte, and warm lying under the
trees, and so in the morning to make our second search. The Company was very
willing to yeeld unto it, and the calme night favoured our good intentions. We made
a fire for our Chocolatte, and supped exceeding well of our cold meat, and spent most
part of the night in merry discourse, having a watchfull eye over our <i>Indian</i>, lest hee
should give us the slip, and committing him to the charge of <i>Miguel Dalva</i>. In the
morning wee prayed unto God, beseeching him to guide us that day in the work wee
went about, and to discover unto us the Cave of darkenesse and iniquity, where lay
hid that instrument of Satan, that so by his discovery Glory might bee given unto our
true God, and shame and punishment brought upon his enemies. Wee entered againe
into the thick Wood up a steepy hill, and having throughly searched all the
South side of it, wee went on to the North side, where wee found another deepe descent,
which wee began to walke downe looking on every side, and not in vain; for
almost half a mile from the top wee found some markes of a way that had been used and
trodden, which wee followed untill we came to another spring of water; we searched
narrowly about it, and found some peeces of broken earthen dishes and pots, and one
peece of a chafing dish, such as the <i>Indians</i> use to burne Frankincense in, in the Churches
before their Saints, we verily imagined that these were peeces of some such instruments
wherewith the idolaters performed their duty unto their Idol, and we were the more
comforted for that wee knew that earthenware had beene made in <i>Mixco</i>; the pine
Tree which immediately we discovered confirmed our hopes. When wee came unto
it we made very little more search, for neer at hand was the Cave, which was dark within,
but light at the mouth, where wee found more Earthen ware, with ashes in them,
which assured us of some Frankincense that had been burned. Wee knew not how
farre the Cave might reach within, nor what might bee in it, and therefore with a flint
wee struck fire and lighted a couple of candles and went in; at the entering it was
broad, and went a little forward, but when wee were in, we found it turn on the left
hand towards the mountaine, and not farre; for within two rods wee found the Idol
standing upon a low stooll covered with a linnen cloth. The substance of it was wood,
black shining like Jet, as if it had been painted or smoaked, the form was of a mans
head unto the shoulders, without either Beard or Mustachoes; his looke was grim
with a wrinkled forehead, and broad startling eyes. We feared not his frowning look,
but presently seized upon him; and as wee lifted him up we found under him some single
Rials, which his Favorites had offered unto him; which made us search more diligently
the Cave; and it was not amisse, for wee found upon the ground more single
Rials, some plantines and other fruits, wax candles halfe burned, pots of Maiz, one
little one of Hony, little dishes wherein Frankincense had been burned, whereby I perceived
the Idolaters and Christians both agreed in their offerings; and had I not been
informed that they called this Idol their God, I could have blamed them no more then
the rest of the Townes who worship, kneel before and offer such offerings unto their
Saints made of Wood, and some no handsomer then was this Idol, which I thought,
might have beene some beasts shape; but being the shape and form of a man, they
might have named him by the name of some Saint, and so some way have excused themselves,
which they could not doe, nor would they doe it, in that they persisted in this
error, that he was their God, and had spoken and preached unto them, and being afterwards
asked by mee, whether it were the picture of any Saint, such as were in <i>Mixco</i>,
and other Churches, they answered, No, but that hee was above all the Saints in the
Countrey.</p>

<p>Wee were very joyfull to see that wee had not spent our time in vaine, wee cut
down boughes of trees, and filled the Cave with them and stopped the mouth of it up,
and came away, making the <i>Indian</i> that went with us carry the Idol on his back wrapped
up in a cloth, that it might not bee seen or perceived as wee went. I thought it fit
to delay the time till night, and then to enter into <i>Mixco</i>, that the <i>Indians</i> might see
nothing. So I stayed at one of the <i>Spaniards</i> houses, till it were late, and desired him
to warn from mee all the <i>Spaniards</i> there-abouts to be at <i>Mixco</i> Church the next Sabbath,
(fearing lest the Idolaters might bee many, and rise up against mee) that I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
somewhat to say onto them and their Blackmores concerning their Sodalities, for I
would not have them know of the Idoll, till they heard of it and saw it in the Church,
lest it should come to the <i>Indians</i> hearing, and so the Idolaters might absent themselves.
At night I tooke my <i>Indian</i>, and <i>Miguel Dalva</i> with mee, and went home, and
shutting up the Idol in a chest till the next Sabbath, I dismissed the <i>Indian</i>, charging
him to say nothing, for hee knew if hee did what harme might come unto him from
the Idolaters, and I knew few words now would suffice, for that hee feared himselfe
if it should bee known that hee had been with mee, I kept <i>Miguel Dalva</i> with mee,
who was desirous to see the end of the businesse, and prepared my self against the next
Sabbath to preach upon the 3 v. of the 20. of <i>Exodus, Thou shalt have none other Gods before
mee,</i> though it were a Text nothing belonging to the Gospel of the day, from whence
commonly in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, the Texts and subjects of Sermons are deducted;
but I judged that Text most seasonable for the present occasion. On the Sabbath day
in the morning, when the Pulpit was made ready by him who had care of the Church
and Altars, I caused <i>Miguel Dalva</i> to carry under his Cloak the Idol, and to leave it
in the Pulpit upon the ground that it might not bee seene, till such time as I
should thinke fit in my Sermon to produce it, and to watch about the Church
till the Congregation came in, that none might see it or take it away. Never was there
a greater resort from abroad to that Church then that day of <i>Spaniards</i> and Blackmores,
who by the warning I sent unto them expected some great matter from mee,
and of the Town very few were absent, the <i>Fuentes</i> and all the rest that were suspected
to be that Idols favorites (little thinking that their God was brought from his Cave, and
now lay hid in the Pulpit to shame them) came also that day to Church. I commanded
<i>Miguel Dalva</i>, to bee himself neer the Pulpit at Sermon time, and to warne
those <i>Spaniards</i> that knew the businesse, and some more Blackmores his friends to bee
also neere the Pulpit staires.</p>

<p>Thus Masse being ended, I went up to preach; when I rehearsed the words of
my Text, I perceived both <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Indians</i> began to look one upon another, as not
being used to Sermons out of the Old Testament. I went on laying open this command of
God, for having no other Gods before him, so that the Doctrine might seem to convince
all that were there present, as well Saint-worshippers, as indeed that Idols worshippers, if
the cause of my preaching upon that Subject had not diverted their eyes from themselves
to behold their own guiltiness of Idolatry, &amp; to look only upon those who worshipped
a peece of wood for God, &amp; not, as they did, for a Saint (which yet in my judgment was
much alike.) After I had spoken what I thought fit concerning that horrible sin, and
shewed that no creature could have the power of God (who was the Creator of all
things) neither could doe good or harme without the true living Gods Commission,
especially inanimate Creatures as stocks, and stones, who by the hands and workmanship
of man might have eyes, and yet were dead Idols, and see not, might have eares and
not heare, might have mouths, and not speak, might have hands, and not worke, nor
helpe or defend with them such as worshipped them, and bowed down unto them.</p>

<p>Thus having halfe finished my Sermon, I bowed my selfe downe in the Pulpit, and
lifted up the black, grim, and staring Devill, and placed that Dagon on one side of the
Pulpit, with my eyes fixed upon some of the <i>Fuentes</i> and others, who I perceived changed
their colour, blushed, and were sore troubled looking one upon another, I desired
the Congregation to behold what a God was worshipped by some of them, and
all to take notice of him, if any knew what part of the earth was the Dominion of
this God, or from whence hee came. I told them that some had boasted that
this peece of wood had spoken, and preached against what I had taught of Christ,
and that therefore hee was worshipped by them for God, and they had offered mony,
hony, and of the fruits of the earth unto him, and burnt Frankincense before him in a
secret and hidden Cave under the earth, shewing thereby that they were ashamed to own
him publickly, and that hee lurking in the darknesse of the earth, shewed certainly
that hee belonged to the Prince of darknesse. I challenged him there in publicke to
speak for himself, or else by silence to shame and confound all his worshippers. I shewed
them how being but wood, hee had been made and fashioned by the hands of man,
and therefore was but a dead idol. I spent a great deal of time arguing with him, and
defying Satan who had used him as his instrument, daring the Devill himselfe to take
him from that place which I had confined him to if hee could, to shew what little power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
he or Satan had against the power of my faith in Christ. After much arguing and reasoning
according to the shallow capacity of the <i>Indians</i> present, I told them if that
their God had power to deliver him from that execution, which I had intended against
him (which was there publikely to have him cut in pieces and burnt) they should not
beleeve the Gospell of Jesus Christ; but if they saw no power at all in him against
me the weakest instrument of the true living God, then I beseeched them to be converted
unto that true God who created all things, and to imbrace salvation by his Son
the only Mediatour and Saviour Jesus Christ, and to renounce and abjure from that
time all Heathenish Idolatry of their forefathers, assuring them for what was past I
would intercede for them, and secure them from what punishment might be inflicted
upon them by the President and Bishop, and if they would come to me, I would spend
my best indeavours for the helping and furthering of them in the way of Christianity.</p>

<p>And thus concluding without naming any person, I went downe out of the pulpit,
and caused the Idol to be brought after me, and sending for an axe, and for two or
three great pans of coales, I commanded him to be hewen in very small peeces, and to
be cast in the fire and burned before all the people in the midst of the Church. The
<i>Spaniards</i> cried out joyfully <i>Victor Victor</i>, and others repeated, <i>Gloria à nostro Dios</i>,
Glory to our God, the Idolaters held their peace and spake not then a word. But afterwards
they acted most spightfully against me, and conspired day and night to get
me at some advantage, and to kill me. I writ to the President of <i>Guatemala</i> informing
him of what I had done; and to the Bishop (as an Inquisitor to whom such cases
of idolatry did belong) to be informed from him of what course I should take with
the <i>Indians</i> who were but in part yet discovered unto me, and those onely by the relation
of one <i>Indian</i>. From both I received great thanks for my paines in searching the
mountaine, and finding out the Idol, and for my zeal in burning of it. And as touching
the <i>Indian</i> Idolaters their counsell unto me was, that I should further enquire after
the rest and discover as many as I could, and indeavour to convert them to the
knowledge of the true God by faire and sweet meanes, shewing pity unto them for
their great blindnesse, and promising them upon their repentance pardon from the Inquisition,
which considering them to be but new plants useth not such rigour with
them, which it useth with <i>Spaniards</i> if they fall into such horrible sins. This advise
I followed, and sent privately for the <i>Fuentes</i> to my chamber, and told them how mercifull
the Inquisition was unto them, expecting their conversion and amendment. They
seemed somewhat stubborne and angry for that I had burned that God, whom not only
they, but many others in the Towne, and also in the Towne of Saint <i>John Sacatepeques</i>
did worship. I used reasons to perswade them no honour was due unto it, as to a
God. But one of them boldly replyed, that they knew that it was a peece of wood
and of it selfe could not speake, but seeing it had spoken (as they were all witnesses)
this was a miracle whereby they ought to be guided, and they did verily beleeve that
God was in that piece of wood, which since the speech made by it was more then ordinary
wood, having God himselfe in it, and therefore deserved more offerings and adoration
then those Saints in the Church, who did never speake unto the people. I
told them that the Devill rather had framed that speech (if any they had heard) for
to deceive their souls and lead them to hell; which they might easily perceive from the
Doctrin which I was informed he had preached against Christ the only begotten son
of God, whom the Father loveth and in whom he is well pleased, and against whom
he certainly would not speake in that idol. Another answered boldly, our forefathers
never knew what Christ was, until the <i>Spaniards</i> came unto that Countrey, but they
knew there were Gods, &amp; did worship them, and did sacrifice unto them; and for ought
they knew this God of theirs belonged in old times unto their forefathers. Why then,
said I unto them, he was a weake God who by my hands hath been burned? I perceived
that at that time there was no reasoning with them, for they were stubborn and
captious, and so I dismissed them. Had not God most graciously protected me against
these my enemies, I had certainly been murthered by them; for a moneth after the
burning of the idol, when I thought all had been forgotten, and that the Idolaters
were quiet, then they began to act their spight and malice, which first I discovered by a
noise which once at midnight I heard of people about my house, and at my chamber
doore; to whom I called out from my bed not daring to open, but could have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
answer from them, I perceived they would have come in by force, for they pushed hard
at the doore. Whereupon I tooke suddainly the sheets from off my bed, tying them
with a strong knot together, and with another to a bar of the window, making my
selfe ready to fall down by them to the ground, and so to flie in the dark night, if they
had used violence to come in. The sheets being thus prepared, and they still at the
doore thrusting without any word from them, I thought by calling and crying out
aloud I might affright them away. Wherefore with a shrill voice I called first to my servants,
who were but boyes, and lay at the further end of a long gallery, then I cryed
out to the neighbouring houses to come and assist me against theeves. The servants had
heard the noise and were awake, who presently at my call came out; and with their
coming my enemies ran down the staires, and were heard no more that night. But I
perceiving which way their spight and malice was bent, thought fit to be no more alone
in the night, with boyes only in so great a house as was that of <i>Mixco</i>; whereupon
the next day I sent for my trusty friend <i>Miguel Dalva</i> who was able to fight alone
with any halfe dozen of <i>Indians</i>, wishing him to bring with him what weapons
he could get for my defence. I kept him with me a fortnight; and the next Sabbath
I gave warning in the Church, that whosoever came in the night to my house to affright
me, or to doe me any other mischiefe should looke to him selfe, for that I had
weapons both offensive and defensive. Though for a while I heard no more of them,
yet they desisted not altogether from their evill and malicious intents; for, knowing
that <i>Miguel Dalva</i> did not lie in the same chamber with me, a fortnight after (I being
till about midnight with my candle studying) they came up the staires so softly that I
heard them not; but the <i>Black-more</i> being awake it seems perceived that they were
coming up, and softly arose up from a long table where he lay upon a Mat, and tooke
in his hand a couple of brick-bats of many which lay under the table for a worke
which I had in hand, and as he opened the dore made a little noise, which was to them
an item to flie down the staires, and to run (as they thought) for their lives. The
<i>Black-more</i> did also run after them, and finding they had got too much advantage of
him, and not knowing which way they might take, sent after them with a fury his
two brick-bats, wherewith he supposed he did hit one of them, for the next day walking
about the Towne he met with one of the <i>Fuentes</i> having a cap on his head, and he
inquired of some <i>Indians</i> what he ailed, and he understood by them that his head was
broke, but how they knew not. They perceiving that I was thus guarded by <i>Miguel
Dalva</i>, desisted from that time from coming any more in the night unto my
house, but yet desisted not from their spight and malice and from acting mischiefe against
me. For a month after when I thought that all had been forgotten, and they
seemed outwardly to be kind and curteous, there came a messenger to me from the oldest
of them, named <i>Pablo de Fuentes</i>, to tel me that he was very sick, and like to die, and
desired me to goe to comfort and instruct him in the truth, for that he truely desired to
be converted. I conceived very great joy at this newes, and doubted not of the truth and
certainty of it, and prayed to God to direct me in the conversion of that soul; and
so with haste and good zeal, I went unto his house, where soon my joy and comfort
was turned into bitternesse; for when I came to the dore of his house, and was with
one step entred, I found all the brothers of <i>Pablo Fuentes</i>, and some others who were
suspected to be Idolaters, sitting round the room; and missing <i>Pablo</i>, I withdrew my foot
a little, and asked them where he was, mistrusting somewhat to see them there all gathered
together; but when I perceived that they stood not up, nor answered me a word,
nor so much as tooke off their hats to me, then I began to fear indeed, and to suspect
some treachery; and so I turned back resolving to goe home again. But no sooner
was I turned, but behold <i>Pablo Fuentes</i> (who by his message had feigned both sicknesse
and conversion) came from behind his house with a cudgell in his hand, lifting it up
to strike at me. Had I not catched hold of his stick with both my hands, and prevented
the intended blow, certainly he had struck me down. But whilst he and I were
striving for the stick who should be Master of it, the rest of the <i>Indians</i> who were sitting
in the house, came out into the yard (which being a publick place was more comfort
to me then if they had compassed me about within the house) and beset me round,
some pulling mee one way, some another, tearing my clothes in two or three places,
another to make me let goe my hand from the stick with a knife run me into the hand
(which to this day a small scar doth witnesse) and certainly had we not been in a publike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
yard, that party would also have run his knife into my sides; another seeing I
would not let goe the stick, tooke hold of it with <i>Pablo</i> and both together thrust it
against my mouth, and with such strength that they broke some of my teeth, and filled
my mouth with goar blood, with which blow I fell, but soone recovered my selfe
and arose, they laughing at me, but not daring to doe me any more harme for feare
they should be seen, as God would have seen what already they had done; for a Mulatta
slave to a <i>Spaniard</i> in the valley, at that very time when I was down and rising passed
by, and hearing me cry out for help to the neighbours (who lived somewhat far
off that might helpe and succour me, for all the houses thereabouts were of the brothers
the <i>Fuentes</i>) came into the yard, and seeing me all in blood thought I had been
mortally wounded, and calling them murtherers ran along the street crying murther,
murther in <i>Pablo Fuentes</i> his yard, till she came to the Market place and Town-house,
where she found the Maiors and Jurats sitting, &amp; a couple of <i>Spaniards</i>, who when they
heard of my danger, with drawn swords came presently running with all the officers of
Justice to the yard of <i>Pablo Fuentes</i> to aid and assist me; but in the mean while the Idolaters
perceiving the outcry of the Mulatta, began to fall away and to hide themselves;
<i>Pablo Fuentes</i> going to shut up his house also to absent himselfe, I held him hard to it,
striving with him that he might not escape away till some help came unto me. The <i>Spaniards</i>
when they came and saw me all in a blood, made furiously to <i>Pablo Fuentes</i> with
their naked swords, whom I stopped desiring them not to hurt him, lest what harme
they did unto him should be imputed unto me. I wished the Justice not to feare him
though he were a rich <i>Indian</i>, and as they would answer before the President of <i>Guatemala</i>
to lay hold of him, and to carry him to prison, which they presently performed.
I made the <i>Spaniards</i> and the Mulatta to witnesse under writing by way of information
what they had seen, what blood about my clothes, what wound in my
hand, what blow in my mouth they had found, and sent with speed to the President
of <i>Guatemala</i> this their information. The businesse was soon noised about the valley,
whereupon most of the <i>Spaniards</i> came to offer their help and aid unto me; <i>Miguel
Dalva</i> also chancing to be neer at a <i>Spaniards</i> house in the same valley came with the
rest, who would have done that night some mischief among the <i>Indians</i> if I had not
prevented them. I desired them to depart and goe home to their houses, telling them
I feared nothing, and that <i>Miguel Dalva</i> his company would be guard enough unto
me. But they would by no meanes yeeld unto this, saying that night might prove
more dangerous unto me then I imagined, and that I needed a stronger guard then of
one man alone, for they conceived that the Idolaters knowing what already they had
done, and fearing what grievous punishment might be inflicted upon them from the
President of <i>Guatemala</i>, seeing themselves lost and undone men might desperately that
night rescue their brother out of prison, and attempt some mischiefe against me, and
so flie away. Which I could not be brought to fear, or to beleeve any such thing of
their cowardly spirits, nor that they would flie away for that they had houses and
land there in and about the Towne, yet I was willing for one night to yeeld to have a
stronger guard of <i>Spaniards</i> then at other times I had had with the Blackmore <i>Miguel
Dalva</i> alone. After supper they kept watch about my house till such time as they perceived
all was still, and the <i>Indians</i> a bed, and then they set a watch about the prison
that <i>Pablo Fuentes</i> might not be taken out. And after this (pretending that they were
in danger as wel as I being but about a dozen, if the Towne should all rise and mutiny
by the suggestion of the Idolaters, who most of them were rich and powerfull with
the rest, which yet I feared not) they would needs goe and raise up the two Alcaldes
or Maiors alone, with two more petty officers to make search about the Town for the
rest of the <i>Fuentes</i> and other known Idolaters, that being found they might secure them
in the prison to appear at <i>Guatemala</i>, and prevented from doing any mischief either that
night, or at any other time. With this stir which they made, and their care of mee,
they suffered me not to take any rest that night; but went and called up the Alcaldes and
two officers and brought them to my house, desiring me to signifie unto them, how fit
and necessary it was to search for the rest of the <i>Indians</i>. The poore Alcaldes trembled
to see so many <i>Spaniards</i> at that time in my house with naked swords, and durst
not but doe what they thought best to be done, and so from my house about midnight
they walked about the Towne, searching such houses as they most suspected might
conceale any of the <i>Fuentes</i>, or of the rest that had been that day in the rebellion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
mutiny against mee. They could find none at home, till at last comming to the house
of one <i>Lorenzo Fuentes</i>, one of the brothers, they found all that had been in the conspiracy
against mee, gathered together drinking and quaffing. The house being beset
there was no flying nor escaping, and seeing the <i>Spaniards</i> naked swords, they durst
not rebell, who doubtlesse (as wee were afterwards informed) would have made a
great stirre in the Town that night, and were met together to rescue <i>Pablo</i> their brother,
and to doe mee some mischief and flye, not knowing that I was so strongly manned
and guarded by the <i>Spaniards</i>. There were ten of them, and were presently without
any noise in the Town carryed to the Prison, and there shut up, and guarded by the
<i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

<p>In the morning the President of <i>Guatemala</i> (who then was <i>Don Juan de Guzman</i>,
a Religious Governour) taking into his consideration what the day before I had writ
unto him, and judging my danger to bee great, sent a <i>Spanish</i> Alguazile, or Officer of
Justice with a very large Commission to bring Prisoners to the City all those <i>Indians</i>
who the day before had been in rebellion against mee, and in case they could not bee
found, then to seize upon what goods soever of theirs could be found in <i>Mixco</i>. But with
the diligence of the <i>Spaniards</i> the night before they were all in a readinesse for him, and
paying the Alguazile first his charges (which hee demanded as hee listed) and bearing
the charges of <i>Miguel Dalva</i>, and two or three more <i>Spaniards</i>, who were commanded
in the Kings Name to bee aiding and assisting the Officer for the safer carrying them to
<i>Guatemala</i>, they were horsed and had away that day to the President, who committed
them close Prisoners, and afterwards commanded them to be whipped about the streets,
banished two of them from <i>Mixco</i> to the Golf of St. <i>Thomas de Castilia</i>, and would
have banished them all, had they not humbled themselves, and desired mee to intercede
for them, promising to amend their lives, and to make mee great satisfaction, if they
might return again to their Town, and that if ever more they did stirre against mee, they
would yeeld to be hanged and to lose al their goods. With this the President (fining them
yet to pay twenty Crowns a peece to the Church to be imployed in what I should think
fittest) sent them back; who, as they had promised, came unto mee, and humbled
themselves before mee with much weeping, with many expressions, shewing their sorrow
from their hearts for what they had done, casting all upon the Devill, whom they
confessed had been great with them in tempting them, whom also now they did abjure
and renounce, promising to live as good Christians, and never more to worship
any God but one. I was very much taken with their deepe sorrow expressed with many
tears, and indeavoured to instruct them in the true knowledge of Christ, whom now
I found they were very willing to imbrace. I lived not very long after in that Towne;
but for the time I did continue in it, I found a great change and alteration in their
lives, which truly made mee apt to judge that their repentance was unfained. And
these former particulars of a few <i>Indians</i> of those two Towns, I have not here inserted
to bring an aspersion upon all that Nation, (which I doe very much affect, and
would willingly spend the best drops of blood in my veines to doe them good, and
to save their soules) but to cause rather pity and commiseration towards them,
who after so many yeers preaching have been made as yet but formall and outward Christians,
and by the many Saints of wood, which they have been taught to worship by
the Preists, have rather been inclined to the superstition and Idolatry of their Forefathers,
and to trust to living Creatures, and bow to inanimate stocks and stones, which
they daily see performed publickly in their Churches. Certainly they are of a good and
flexible nature, and (were those Idols of Saints statues removed from their eyes)
might bee brought easily to worship one onely God; and whereas they so willingly
lavish out their small meanes and what they labour for, in offerings to the Preists and
to their Saints, and in maintaining Lazy singing Lubbars, they without doubt would
bee free enough to true Ministers of Gods Word, who should venture their lives to
beat down those false Gods, and set up Jesus Christ, and him that sent him into the
World to save such as truly beleeve in him.</p>

<p>The yeere that this stirre happened in <i>Mixco</i>, I received from <i>Rome</i> from the Generall
of the Dominicans Order, License to come home to <i>England</i>; at which I rejoyced
much, for now I was even weary with living among the <i>Indians</i>, &amp; grieved to see the little
fruit I reaped amongst them, and that for feare of the Inquisition I durst not preach
a new Gospell unto them, which might make them true, reall, and inward Christians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and lastly, for that I perceived that <i>Antonio Mendez de Satomayor</i> (who was Lord of
the Towne of <i>Mixco</i>) did stomack me for having caused two of his Towne to bee
banished, and publikely affronted the <i>Fuentes</i> for their Idolatry, which hee thought
was a great aspersion laid upon his <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>All which well considered I writ unto the Provinciall (who was then in <i>Chiapa</i>) of
my desire to returne home to mine owne Countrey, for the which I had a licence sent
unto me from <i>Rome</i>. But he having heard of what good I had done in the Town of
<i>Mixco</i>, in reducing some Idolaters, burning their idol, and venturing my life in so good
a cause; and also for the perfect knowledge which now I had of the <i>Poconchi</i> tongue,
would by no meanes yeeld that I should go; but with fair and flattering words incouraged
me to stay, where he doubted not, but I did, and I might yet doe God much
more good service; and that he might the better worke upon me, he sent me a Patent of
Vicar of the Towne and Cloister of <i>Amatitlan</i>, where at the present there was a new
Cloister a building to separate all that valley from the Cloister of <i>Guatemala</i>. He desired
me to accept of that small preferment, not doubting but that I speaking so well
the <i>Indian</i> language might prevaile much in that place, and better then another, to further
the building of that new Cloister; which worke would be a good step for him to
advance me afterwards to some better preferment. Although I regarded neither that
present Superiority, nor any better honour which might afterwards ensue unto me, I
thought the time which God had appointed for my returning to <i>England</i> was not yet
come; for that if the Provinciall, and with him the President of <i>Guatemala</i> (for so
much I conjectured out of the Provincialls letter) should both oppose and hinder
my departure from that Countrey, it would be very hard for me to take my journey
any way, and not be discovered and brought back. Whereupon I resolved to stay
the Provincialls coming to <i>Guatemala</i>, and there to confer with him face to face, and to
shew him some reasons that moved me to leave that Countrey, and to seek againe mine
owne wherein I was borne. So for the present I accepted of the Towne of <i>Amatitlan</i>,
where I had more occasions of getting mony than in the other two, where I had lived
five full yeers; for albeit that Towne alone was bigger then both <i>Mixco</i> and <i>Pinola</i>
together, and the Church fuller of Saints pictures and statues, and very many Confraternities
and Sodalities belonged unto it; besides this from without the Towne I
had great comings in from the Ingenio of Sugar, which I related before stood close unto
that Towne, from whence I had dayly offerings from the <i>Black-mores</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>
that lived in it; and besides this I had under my charge another lesser Towne called
St. <i>Christoval de Amatitlan</i>, standing two leagues from great <i>Amatitlan</i>. This Town of
St. <i>Christoval</i>, or <i>St. Christopher</i>, is called properly in that language, <i>Palinha, ha,</i> signifying
water, and <i>Pali</i>, to stand upright, and is compounded of two words which express
water standing upright; for the Towne standeth on the back side of the Vulcan of water,
which looketh over <i>Guatemala</i>, and on this side sendeth forth many fountaines,
but especially spouteth forth from a high rock a stream of water, which as it falleth
from high with a great noise and down-fall, the rocke standing upright over the bottome
where it falleth, and causeth a most pleasant stream by the Townes side, it hath
moved the <i>Indians</i> to call their Towne, <i>Palinha</i>, from the high and upright standing
rock, from whence the water falleth. In this Towne there are many rich <i>Indians</i>, who
trade in the coast of the South sea; the Towne is as an harbour shadowed with many
fruitfull trees; but the chief fruit here is the Pinna, which groweth in every <i>Indians</i>
yard, and with the neernesse of the Ingenio of Sugar, are by the <i>Spaniards</i> thereabouts
much made up in Preserves; some whole, some in slices, which is the daintiest
and most luscious Preserve that I ever did eat in that Countrey. The <i>Indians</i> of this
Towne get much by boards of Cedar, which they cut out of many Cedar-trees, which
grow on that side of the Vulcan, which they sell to <i>Guatemala</i> and all about the Countrey
for new buildings.</p>

<p>Between great <i>Amatitlan</i> and this Town the way is plain, and lieth under a Vulcan of
fire, which formerly was wont to smoak as much as that of <i>Guatemala</i>, but having formerly
burst out at the top, and there opened a great mouth, &amp; cast down to the bottome
mighty stones (which to this day are to be seen) it hath not since been any waies troublesome
unto the Countrey. In this way there was in my time a new Trapiche of Sugar
erecting up by one <i>John Baptista</i> of <i>Guatemala</i>, which was thought would prove
very usefull, and profitable unto the foresaid City. I had yet for the time that I lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
in <i>Amatitlan</i> another very little village at my charge, called <i>Pampichi</i> at the bottome
of a high mountaine on the other side of the lake over against it, which was but a Chappell
of ease unto great <i>Amatitlan</i>, unto which I went not above once in a quarter of
a yeer, and that for pastime and recreation; for this village is well in that language a
compound also of <i>Pam</i>, in, and <i>Pichi</i>, flowers, for that it standeth compassed about
with flowers, which make it very pleasant, and the boats or Canoa's which doe constantly
stand neer the doores of the houses, invites to much pleasure of fishing and rowing
about the lake.</p>

<p>And thus whilst I lived in <i>Amatitlan</i> I had the choice of three places wherein to recreate
my selfe, and because the charge of many soules lay in my hands, I had one
constantly to helpe me. The Towne of <i>Amatitlan</i> was as the Court in respect of the
rest, where nothing was wanting that might recreate the mind and satisfie the body
with variety and change of sustenance, both for fish and flesh. Yet the great care that did
lie upon me in the worke and building of the Cloister, made me very soone weary of
living in that great and pleasant Towne; for sometimes I had thirty, sometimes twenty,
sometimes fewer, and sometimes fourty worke-men to looke unto, and to pay
wages to on Saturday nights, which I found wearied much my braine, and hindred
my studies, and was besides a worke which I delighted not in, nor had any hopes
ever to enjoy it. And therefore after the first yeer that I had been there I betooke my
selfe unto the Provinciall, who was in <i>Guatemala</i>, and againe earnestly besought him
to peruse the Licence which I had from <i>Rome</i> to goe to <i>England</i> mine owne Countrey
for to preach there (for that was the chiefe ground of letting me goe home, as the
Generall largely expressed) where I doubted not but I might doe God great service,
and in Conscience I told him I thought I was bound to employ what parts God had
bestowed upon me, rather upon my own Countreymen, then upon <i>Indians</i> and strangers.
The Provinciall replyed unto me that my Countrey men were Heretickes, and
when I came amongst them they would hang me up. I told him, I hoped better
things of them, and that I would not behave my selfe among them so as to deserve
hanging, not daring to tell him what was in my heart concerning points of Religion.
After a long discourse I found the Provinciall inexorable, and halfe angry, telling
me that he and that whole Province had cast their eyes upon me, and honoured
me, and were ready and willing to promote me further, and that I would shew my
selfe very ungratefull unto them, if I should forsake them for my owne nation and
people, whom I had not knowne from my young and tender age. I perceived there
was no more to be said, and all would be in vaine, and so resolved to take my best opportunity,
and with my Licence from <i>Rome</i> to come away unknowne unto him. But
for the present I humbly beseeched him to remove me from <i>Amatitlan</i>, for that I found
my selfe unable to undergoe that great charge, and too weake for that strong worke,
that was then building. With much adoe he would be brought to this, alleadging
what an honour it was to be a Founder and builder of a new Cloister, in whose walls
my very name would be engraven to posterity; all which I told him I regarded not, but
estemed more of my health and a quiet mind, then of such preferments and vanities.
Upon which at last he condescended to my request, and gave me order to goe to <i>Petapa</i>,
and that the Vicar of <i>Petapa</i> should goe to finish the worke of <i>Amatitlan</i>. In <i>Petapa</i>
I lived above a twelve moneth, with great ease, pleasure and content for all things
worldly and outward; but within I had still a worme of Conscience, gnawing this
gourd that shadowed and delighted me with worldly contentment. Here I grew more
and more troubled concerning some points of Religion, dayly wishing with <i>David</i>,
that I had the wings of a Dove, that I might flie from that place of dayly Idolatry
into <i>England</i>, and be at rest. I resolved therefore to put on a good courage, and relie
wholly upon my God, knowing that the journey was hard and dangerous, and might
bring shame and trouble unto me, if I should be taken in the way flying and brought
back to <i>Guatemala</i>; here I weighed the affliction and reproach which might ensue unto
me, after so much honor, pleasure, and wealth which I had enjoyed for about twelve
yeers in that Countrey; but in another balance of better consideration, I weighed the
trouble of a wounded Conscience, and the spirituall joy and comfort that I might enjoy
at home with the people of God, and so resolutely concluded upon that place of
<i>Heb.</i> 11. 25, 26, 27. with <i>Moses</i>, to choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God (who as <i>Paul</i> well observeth, I <i>Thes.</i> 3. 3. are appointed thereunto; and again <i>Phil.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
1. 29. unto whom it is given in the behalfe of Christ, not onely to beleeve in him,
but also to suffer for his sake) then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season; esteeming
the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasures in <i>Egypt</i>. So for
faith and a safe conscience I now purposed likewise with <i>Moses</i> to forsake <i>Egypt</i>, not
fearing the wrath of the President the Kings owne Deputy, nor of the Provinciall,
and my best friends; but to indure all this (if I should be taken) as seeing him who
is invisible. I thought this was a businesse not to be conferred with flesh and blood,
lest the best friend knowing of it should betray me; yet on the other side, I thought
it hard to flie alone without some friend for the first two or three daies journey; and
besides having many things to sell away to make mony of, I thought I were better to
imploy some trusty friend, then to doe all alone. I thought of none fitter then <i>Miguel
Dalva</i>, whom by long experience I knew to be true and trusty, and that a small
mony matter would content him; whom I sent for to <i>Pinola</i>, and charging him with
secrecy, I told him I had a journey for my conscience sake to make to <i>Rome</i> (I would
not tell him that I intended <i>England</i>, lest the good old <i>Black-more</i> should grieve thinking
never more to see me, and for the love he bare me, and interest he had many times
from me, he should by discovering my intent, seek to stop me) which I would have
none to know of but himselfe, not doubting but to returne againe, as he knew many
had taken the like journey, and returned within two yeers.</p>

<p>The <i>Black-more</i> offered himselfe to goe with me, which I refused, telling him that
the seas would be too hard for his old age to endure, and that as a <i>Black-more</i> in foraine
Countries he might be stopped and apprehended for a fugitive; which reason he liked
well, and offered himselfe to goe with mee as farre as the sea side; for which I
thanked him and employed to sell me away some Mules, Wheat, and Maiz which I
had, and what else might well passe through his hands. As for many rich pictures
which hung in my chamber, I thought the Towne of <i>Petapa</i> would buy them for their
Church, and propounded it unto the Governour, who willingly accepted of them.
Most of my bookes, chests, cabinets, quilts, and many good peices of houshold-stuffe,
by the paines and industry of <i>Miguel</i> (whom I kept with me for the space of two
moneths before I came away) I sold to <i>Guatemala</i>, reserving onely two Peraca's or
leatherne chests, with some bookes and a quilt for my journey. When I had sold all
that I intended, I found I had in <i>Spanish</i> mony neer nine thousand peeces of eight,
which I had got in twelve yeers that I lived in that Country. So much mony I thought
would be too combersome for a long journey; whereupon I turned above four thousand
of them into pearles and some pretious stones, which might make my carriage
the lighter; the rest I laid up some in bags, some I sowed into my quilt, intending in
the way to turne them into <i>Spanish</i> Pistols. Thus the chiefe provision being made of
mony, I tooke care for Chocolatte and some Conserves for the way, which were soon
provided. Now because I considered that my flight the first week must be with speed,
and that my chests could not post day and night as my selfe intended to doe; I thought
of sending my carriage four dayes at least before me; and not daring to trust any <i>Indian</i>
of <i>Petapa</i>, I sent to <i>Mixco</i> for one speciall <i>Indian</i> friend whom I had there, who
knew the way that I was to travaile very well; to whom I opened my mind, and offered
what mony I knew would well content him, and at midnight sent him away with
two Mules, one for himselfe, and another for my chests, wishing him to keep on
travelling towards <i>St. Miguel</i>, or <i>Nicaragua</i> till I overtooke him. I gave him the
advantage of four daies and nights, and then resolutely with my good <i>Blackmore</i> in
my company leaving the key of my chamber in my doore, and nothing but old
papers within, when all the <i>Indians</i> where fast sleep, I bad adieu unto <i>Petapa</i>, and to
the whole valley, and to all my friends throughout <i>America</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XXI" id="CHAP_XXI">CHAP. XXI.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing my journey from the Towne of</i> Petapa, <i>into</i> England; <i>and some
chiefe passages in the way.</i></h4>


<p>The chiefe thing which troubled me in my resolved purpose to come home, was
the choice of the safest way; which made me utterly forsake the Gulfe (though
the easiest way of all, and that sea neerest to the place where I lived) for that
I knew I should meet there with many of my acquaintance, and the setting out
of the ships was so uncertain, that before they departed, order might come from <i>Guatemala</i>
to stop me; if I should go by land through <i>Comayagua</i> to <i>Truxillo</i>, and there wait
for the ships, likewise I feared lest the Governour of that place by some item from the
President of <i>Guatemala</i> might examine me, and send me backe, and that the Masters
of the ships might have charge given them not to receive me into their ships. If I should
goe backe to <i>Mexico</i> and <i>Vera Cruz</i>, then I called to mind, how I was troubled in that
long journey, when I came first to <i>Chiapa</i> in company of friends, and that now alone I
should certainly be much put to it, for I would not carry <i>Miguel Dalva</i> so far by land with
me. Wherefore rejecting these three wayes, I chose the fourth, which was by <i>Nicaragua</i>
and the Lake of <i>Granada</i>; and therefore I deferred my journey till the week after <i>Christmas</i>,
knowing that the time of the frigats setting out from that lake to the <i>Havana</i> was
commonly after the middle of <i>January</i>, or at <i>Candlemas</i> at the furthest, whither I hoped
to reach in very good time. Now that I might by no means be suspected to have
taken this way; before I went I left by the hand of <i>Miguel Dalva</i> a letter to a friend of
his to be delivered to the Provinciall in <i>Guatemala</i>, foure dayes after my departure,
wherein I kindly tooke my leave of him, desiring him not to blame me nor to seeke
after me; and whereas I had a sufficient Licence from <i>Rome</i>, and could not get his, that
I thought I might with a safe Conscience goe where I was born, leaving Linguists enough
to supply my place amongst the <i>Indians</i>. And because he should not make enquiry
after me by <i>Nicaragua</i>, I dated and subscribed my letter to him from the Towne
of <i>St. Antonio Suchutepeques</i>, which was the way to <i>Mexico</i> and quite contrary to <i>Nicaragua</i>.</p>

<p>The next day after <i>Twelfth</i> day, being the seventh of <i>January</i>, 1637. at midnight I
set out of <i>Petapa</i> upon a lusty Mule (which afterwards in the way I sold for fourscore
peeces of eight) with <i>Miguel Dalva</i> alone; and the first part of the way being very hilly
we could not goe so fast as our hearts would have posted; for it was breake of day
before we could get to the top of the mountaine, which is called <i>Serro Redondo</i>, or the
round hill; which is much mentioned in that Countrey, for the good pasture there
which serveth for the Cattell and Sheep, when the valleys below are burnt and no grasing
left for Beasts. This hill is also a great refuge to Travellers, for there they find
good entertainment in a <i>Venta</i>, where wine and provision is sold, and is a great Lodge,
for to lay up dry what carriages they bring; there is besides one of the best Estancia's
or farmes of Cattell in the Countrey, where of Goats and Ewes milke is made the best
cheese thereabouts. This round hill or mountaine is five leagues from <i>Petapa</i>, where
I feared I might meet with some people of <i>Petapa</i>, and therefore the day now dawning
I made haste by it, leaving in the lodge asleep many <i>Indians</i>, who attended on two <i>Spanish</i>
Requa's of Mules, which that day were to goe to <i>Petapa</i>; foure leagues further
from this <i>Serro Redondo</i> is a Towne of <i>Indians</i> called <i>Los Esclavos</i>, or the Slaves, not
that now they are more slaves then the rest of the <i>Indians</i>, but because in the old time
of <i>Montezuma</i> the Emperour, and the <i>Indian</i> Kings that were under him, the people
of this Towne were more slaves then any other, for from <i>Amatitlan</i> (which is so called
from <i>Amat</i>, which in the <i>Mexican</i> tongue signifieth Letter, and <i>Itlan</i> which signifieth
Towne, for that it was the Towne of Letters as some say, for a rine of a tree,
whereon they were wont formerly to write and expresse their minds, or because it was
the place whither from all parts letters were sent to be carried about the Countrey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to <i>Peru</i>) these <i>Indians</i> of the Towne of <i>Esclavo's</i> or slaves, were commanded as slaves
to goe all about the Countrey with letters, or whatsoever else they should be charged
with; and they were bound constantly to send every week so many of their Towne
(as were appointed) unto <i>Amatitlan</i>, there to wait and attend the pleasure of that
Towne for the conveying of letters, or any carriages to other parts.</p>

<p>This Towne of <i>los Esclavos</i> standeth in a bottome by a river, over the which the <i>Spaniards</i>
have built a very strong stone Bridge to goe in and out of the Town, for otherwise
with mules there is no passing by reason of the violent and rapid streame of the
water, and many rocks in the River, from which the water falleth down with great
force. From this Town (where wee onely stayed to drink a cup of Chocolatte and
to bait our mules) wee went on that day to <i>Aguachapa</i>, being ten leagues further, and
not farre from the South Sea, and the port called <i>De la Trinidad</i>; whither wee came
towards Evening, having that day and part of the night travelled about threescore <i>English</i>
miles up hils, and upon stony wayes from the <i>Esclavo's</i> unto this Town; which
is much mentioned in that Country for two things. The one is for the earthen ware
which is made there (as some think) exceeding that of <i>Mixco</i>. The other is for a
place within a mile and a halfe from the Town, which the <i>Spaniards</i> doe credibly
report and beleeve to be a mouth of hell. For out of it there is constantly ascending a
thick black smoak smelling of Brimstone, with some flashes now and then of fire;
the earth from whence this smoak ariseth is not high, but low. None ever durst draw
nigh to find out the truth and ground of it; for those that have attempted to doe it, have
been stricken down to the ground and like to lose their lives. A friend of mine a
Fryer (whom I thought verily I might beleeve) upon his oath affirmed unto me, that
travelling that way with a Provinciall hee resolved to goe unto the place, and satisfie
himselfe of the ground and cause of the strange talke which was every where about
the Country concerning that smoke. He went within a quarter of a mile of it, and presently,
hee said, he heard a hideous noise, which together with the stench of the fiery
smoke and brimstone, struck him into such a fear that he was like to fall to the ground,
and retiring himself back with all speed was taken with a burning Feaver, which was like
to cost him his life. Others report that drawing neer unto it, they have heard great
cries as it were of men and women in torment, noise of iron, of chaines, and the like,
which (how simply I leave it to my Judicious Reader) maketh them beleeve that it is
a mouth of hell. Of my knowledge I will say no more, but that I saw the smoke, and
asked the <i>Indians</i> what was the cause of it; and if ever they had been neer unto
it? And they answered mee, that they could not imagine what might bee the cause of
it, neither durst they draw nigh unto it; and that they had seen Travellers, attempting
to goe neere it, and that they were all stricken either to the ground, or with some
suddaine amazement, or Feaver. I told them that I would walke thither my self, and
they desired mee that I would not, if I loved my life. It was not yet for all this report
the feare of being so neer the <i>Spaniards</i> hell (as they call it) that made me haste
with speed out of that Town, but fear of some messenger that might come after mee to
stop my journy. For at midnight I departed from thence, and went to breake my
fast to a great Town called <i>Chalchuapan</i>, where the <i>Indians</i> made very much of mee, being
<i>Pocomanes</i>, who spake the <i>Poconchi</i> or <i>Pocoman</i> tongue which I had learned. They
would willingly have had me to stay with them and preach unto them the next Sabbath,
which I would have done, had not a better designe called upon mee to make
haste.</p>

<p>Here I was troubled, how I should get through St. <i>Salvador</i>, which was a City of
<i>Spaniards</i>, and wherein there was a Cloister of Dominicans, whom I feared most of
all, because I was known by some of them. My resolution was therefore when I came
neere unto the City, to turn out of my way to a <i>Spaniards</i> Farm as if I had lost my
way, and there to delay the time till Evening in drinking Chocolatte, discoursing, and
baiting my mules well, that so I might travell all that night, and bee out of the reach
of that City, and Fryers (who lived in <i>Indian</i> Towns about it) the next morning,
early. This City of St. <i>Salvador</i> is poore, not much bigger then <i>Chiapa</i>, and is governed
by a <i>Spanish</i> Governour. It standeth forty leagues at least from <i>Guatemala</i>, and
towards the North Sea side, is compassed with very high mountains, which are called
Chuntales, where the <i>Indians</i> are very poore. In the bottome where the City standeth
there are some <i>Trabiches</i> of Sugar, some Indigo made, but the chief Farmes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Estancia's of Cattell. Towards Evening I departed from that Farm where I had well
refreshed my selfe and my Mule, and about eight of the clock I rid through the City
not being known by any body. My purpose was to bee the next morning at a great
River, called <i>Rio de Lempa</i>, some ten leagues from St. <i>Salvador</i>, for within two leagues
of it there lived in an <i>Indian</i> Town a Fryer belonging to the Cloister of St. <i>Salvador</i>
who knew mee very well. But such haste I made that before break of the day I passed
through that Town, and before seven of the clock I was at the River, where I found
my <i>Indian</i> of <i>Mixco</i> ready to passe over with my carriage, who that morning by three
of the clock had set out of that Town two leagues off. I was not a little glad to have
overtaken my Chests, wherein was most of my treasure. There I sate down a while by
the River whilst my mules grazed, and my <i>Indian</i> struck fire and made me Chocolatte.
This River of <i>Lempa</i> is held the broadest, and biggest in all the Jurisdiction belonging
unto <i>Guatemala</i>; there are constantly two Ferry Boats to passe over the Travellers,
and their Requa's of Mules. This River is privileged in this manner, that if a man
commit any hainous crime or murther on this side of <i>Guatemala</i>, and <i>San Salvador</i>, or
on the other side of St. <i>Miguel</i>, or <i>Nicaragua</i>, if hee can flie to get over this River, he
is free as long as hee liveth on the other side, and no Justice on that side whither hee is
escaped can question or trouble him for the murther committed. So likewise for Debts
hee cannot bee arrested. Though I thanked God I neither fled for the one, or for the
other, yet it was my comfort that I was now going over to a priviledged Country, where
I hoped I should bee free and sure, and that if any one did come after mee, hee would
goe no further then to the River of <i>Lempa</i>. My Blackmore did much laugh at this
my conceipt, and warranted mee that all would doe well. Wee Ferried safely over
the River; and from thence went in company with my <i>Indian</i> to a little small Towne
of <i>Indians</i> two leagues off, where wee made the best dinner that we had done from the
Towne of <i>Petapa</i>, and willingly gave rest to all our mules till foure of the clocke in
the afternoone; at which time wee set forth to another small Town little above two
leagues off, through a plain, sandy, and Champaigne Country. The next day wee
had but ten leagues to travaile to a Town called St. <i>Miguel</i>, which belongeth unto
<i>Spaniards</i>, and though it bee not a City, yet is as bigge almost as <i>San Salvador</i>, and
hath a <i>Spanish</i> Governour; in it there is one Cloister of Nuns, and another of Mercenarian
Fryers, who welcomed mee unto their Cloister. For here I began to shew my
face, and to think of selling away the Mule I rid on, being resolved from hence to goe
by water or an Arm of the Sea, to a Town in <i>Nicaragua</i> called <i>La Vieja</i>. I would here
have dismissed my <i>Indian</i>, but hee was loth to leave me untill I got to <i>Granada</i>, where
hee desired to see mee shipped. I refused not his kind offer, because I knew hee was
trusty and had brought my Chests well thither, and knew well the way to <i>Granada</i>.
So I sent him by land to <i>Realejo</i>, or to <i>La Vieja</i>, which stand very neere together and
thirty leagues by land from St. <i>Miguel</i>, and my self stayed that day and till the next day
at noon in that Town, where I sold the mule, I rid on, because I knew that from <i>Realejo</i> to
<i>Granada</i> I could have of the <i>Indians</i> a Mule for nothing for a dayes journey. My Blackmores
mule I sent also by land with the <i>Indian</i>, and the next day went to the Gulfe, being
three or foure miles from St. <i>Miguel</i>, where that afternoone I tooke Boat with
many other passengers, and the next morning by eight in the morning was at <i>La Vieja</i>,
which journey by land would have taken mee up neere three dayes. The next day my
<i>Indian</i> came at night, and wee went to <i>Realejo</i>, (as I have observed before) a Haven
very weak and unfortified on the South Sea; where if I would have stayed one fortnight
I might have taken shipping for <i>Panama</i>, to goe from thence to <i>Portabelo</i>, and
there stay for the Galeons from <i>Spain</i>. But I considered that the Galeons would not
be there till <i>June</i> or <i>July</i>, and that so I should be at great charges in staying so long. But
afterwards I wished I had accepted of that occasion, for I was at last forced to goe to
<i>Panama</i>, and <i>Portabelo</i>. From hence to <i>Granada</i> I observed nothing, but the plainnesse
and pleasantnesse of the way, which with the fruits and fertility of all things may
well make <i>Nicaragua</i> the Paradise of <i>America</i>. Betweene <i>Realejo</i> and <i>Granada</i> standeth
the City of <i>Leon</i>, neere unto a <i>Vulcan</i> of fire, which formerly burst out at the top, and
did much hurt unto all the Country about; but since that it hath ceased, and now
letteth the Inhabitants live without feare. Sometimes it smokes a little, which sheweth
that as yet there is within some sulphurous substance.</p>

<p>Here it was that a Mercenarian Fryer thought to have discovered some great treasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
which might inrich himselfe and all that Country, being fully perswaded that the metall
that burned within that <i>Vulcan</i> was Gold; whereupon hee caused a great Kettle
to bee made, and hung at an iron chain to let it down from the top, thinking therewith
to take up gold enough to make him Bishop and to inrich his poor kindred. But
such was the power and strength of the fire within, that no sooner had hee let downe
the Kettle, when it fell from the chain and from his hands being melted away.</p>

<p>This City of <i>Leon</i> is very curiously built, for the chief delight of the Inhabitants
consisteth in their houses, and in the pleasure of the Country adjoyning, and in the
abundance of all things for the life of man, more then in any extraordinary riches,
which there are not so much injoyed, as in other parts of <i>America</i>. They are contented
with fine gardens, with variety of singing birds, and parrets, with plenty of fish
and flesh, which is cheap, and with gay houses, and so lead a delicious, lazy and idle
life; not aspiring much to trade and traffique, though they have neer unto them the
Lake, which commonly every yeere sendeth forth some Frigats to <i>Havana</i> by the
North Sea, and <i>Realejo</i> on the South Sea, which to them might bee very commodious
for any dealing and rich Trading in <i>Peru</i>, or to <i>Mixco</i>, if their spirits would carry
them so farre: The Gentlemen of this City are almost as vaine and phantasticall as are
those of <i>Chiapa</i>. And especially from the pleasure of this City, is all that Province
of <i>Nicaragua</i>, called by the <i>Spaniards Mahomets</i> Paradise. From hence the way is plain
and Levell to <i>Granada</i>, whither I got safely and joyfully, hoping that now I had no
more journey to make by land, till I should land at <i>Dover</i> in <i>England</i>, and from thence
post up to <i>London</i>. Two dayes after I had arrived at this place and rested my selfe, and
injoyed the pleasant prospect of the Lake, I began to think of dismissing my <i>Indian</i> and
Blackmore. But true and faithfull <i>Miguel Dalva</i> would by no meanes leave mee, till
he saw me shipped; and that I had no more need of him by land; Likewise the <i>Indian</i>
would willingly have stayed, but by no meanes I would permit him, for that I considered
hee had a wife and children to looke to at home. Hee was as willing to return
a foot, as to ride, because hee would have mee sell my mules, and make what mony
I could of them; but I seeing the good nature of the <i>Indian</i>, would recompence
his love with as much mony as might bee more beneficiall to him, then a tired Mule;
which might have dyed in the way under him, and left him on foot; so I gave him
money enough to bear his charges home, and to hire Mules at his one pleasure, and some
to spare, when he came home. The <i>Indian</i> with many teares falling from his eyes, saying,
hee feared hee should never more see mee, tooke his leave of mee the third day after
wee arrived at <i>Granada</i>. My Blackmore and I being left alone, first began to thinke of
selling away the two Mules, which had brought thither the <i>Indian</i>, and my Chests;
for which I got fourscore and ten peeces of eight after so long a journey, and thought
they were well sold. I would have had <i>Miguel</i> have sold away that whereon hee rid,
(which was his own) and offered to buy him another that might better carry him back,
but the loving and carefull Blackmore would not suffer mee to bee at such charges, considering
the long journey which I was to make. After this, wee hearing that the frigats
were not like to depart in a fortnight, thought of viewing well that stately and
pleasant Towne a day or two, and then to betake our selves to some neer <i>Indian</i> Town,
where wee might bee hid, (lest by the great resort of Requa's of Mules, which at that
time brought Indigo and Cochinill from <i>Guatemala</i> to the Frigats, wee should bee discovered)
and might now and then come to the Town to treat concerning my passing
in one of the Frigats to the <i>Havana</i> or to <i>Carthagena</i>. What in that Town wee observed
was, two Cloisters of Mercenarian and Franciscan Fryers, and one of Nuns, very
rich; and one Parish Church, which was as a Cathedrall, for the Bishop of <i>Leon</i> did
more constantly reside there then in the City. The houses are fairer then those of <i>Leon</i>,
and the Town of more Inhabitants, among whom there are some few Merchants of very
great wealth, and many of inferiour degree very well to passe, who trade with <i>Carthagena,
Guatemala, San Salvador</i>, and <i>Comayagua</i>, and some by the South sea to <i>Peru</i>
and <i>Panama</i>. But at this time of the sending away the frigats, that Town is one of the
wealthiest in all the North Tract of <i>America</i>; for the Merchants of <i>Guatemala</i> fearing
to send all their goods by the Gulfe of <i>Honduras</i>, for that they have been often taken
by the <i>Hollanders</i> between that and <i>Havana</i>, think it safer to send them by the frigats
to <i>Carthagena</i>, which passage hath not been so much stopped by the <i>Hollanders</i> as
the other. So likewise many times the Kings treasure, and revenues (when there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
any report of ships at sea, or about the Cape of <i>St. Anthony</i>) are this way by the Lake
of <i>Granada</i> passed to <i>Carthagena</i>. That yeer that I was there, before I betooke my selfe to
an <i>Indian</i> Towne, in one day there entred six Requa's (which were at least three hundred
Mules) from <i>St. Salvador</i> and <i>Comayagua</i> onely, laden with nothing else but Indigo,
Cochinil and Hides; and two dayes after from <i>Guatemala</i> came in three more,
the one laden with silver, which was the Kings tribute from that Countrey; the other
with Sugar, and the other with Indigo. The former Requa's I feared not; but the
latter made me keep close within my lodging, lest going abroad, I should be knowne
by some of those that came from <i>Guatemala</i>; who after they had delivered what they
brought, presently departed, and with their departure set mee at liberty, who
for their sakes was a voluntary prisoner within mine owne lodging. But fearing
lest more of these Requa's might come and affright mee, I went to a Towne out of
the rode, a league from <i>Granada</i>, and took my pleasure up and downe the Countrey
where I was much feasted by the Mercenarian Friers, who enjoy most of those Towns.
Amongst these I heard much of the passage in the frigots to <i>Carthagena</i>, which did not
a little dishearten and discourage me. For although, whilst they saile upon the Lake,
they goe securely and without trouble, yet when they fall from the Lake to the river
(which there they call <i>El Desaguadero</i>) to goe out to the Sea, <i>hic labor, hoc opus est</i>, here
is nothing but trouble, which sometimes makes that short voyage to last two moneths;
for such is the fall of the waters in many places amongst the rockes, that many times
they are forced to unlade the frigots, and lade them again with helpe of Mules which
are there kept for that purpose, by a few <i>Indians</i> that live about the river, and have care
of the Lodges made for to lay in the wares, whilest the frigots passe thorow those dangerous
places to another Lodge, whither the wares are brought by Mules, and put againe
into the frigots. Beside this trouble (which must needs be tedious to a passenger,
to be thus stopped, who would willingly come soone to his journeys end)
the abundance of gnats is such, which maketh him to take no joy in his voiage, and
the heat in some places so intolerable, that many doe die before they get out to the sea.
Though all this was terrible to me to hear, yet I comforted my selfe that my life was
in the hands of the Lord, and that the frigots did commonly every yeer passe that way,
and seldome any were lost. I went now and then to <i>Granada</i> to bargaine for my passage,
and to know when the frigots would for certaine set out, and to provide my
selfe of some dainties and Chocolatte for my journey, having agreed with a Master of
a frigot for my diet at his table. The time was appointed within foure or five dayes;
but suddainly all was crossed with a strict command from <i>Guatemala</i>, that the frigots
should not goe out that yeer, because the President and whole Court was informed
for certaine that some <i>English</i> or <i>Holland</i> ships was abroad at sea, and lay about the
mouth of the river or <i>Desaguadero</i> waiting for the frigots of <i>Granada</i>, and that the said
were sometimes lurking about the Islands of <i>St. John</i>, and <i>St. Catharine</i> (which then
was our <i>Providence</i>) which made all the Merchants of the Countrey to feare and
sweat with a cold sweat, and the President to be carefull for the Kings revenues, lest
the losse of them should be imputed to his wilfull negligence, in stopping the frigots,
whilst he might, and had warning given. This was but sad newes unto me, who
knew not for the present, which way to dispose of my selfe. I began to thinke of the
ship that was at <i>Realejo</i> ready to set out to <i>Panama</i>, thinking that would now be my best
course, but enquiring after it, I was for certaine informed by some Merchants that
it was newly gone. Then my eyes looked upon <i>Comayagua</i> and <i>Truxillo</i>, and upon the
ships of <i>Honduras</i>, but these were but vaine and troubled thoughts, arising from a
perplexed heart, for the ships were also gone from thence, without some small vessell
or frigot might be there with newes from <i>Havana</i> or <i>Carthagena</i> (for those places send
often word and notice of what ships are abroad at sea) but this also was a meer chance,
and not to be trusted unto, as my friends did advise, and counsell me. Whereupon
my perplexity more and more increased; onely my comfort was that there were more
passengers besides my selfe, who I knew must take some course, and whom I also resolved
to follow by sea, or land. Amongst us all we were once resolving to hire a
frigot to carry us onely to <i>Carthagena</i>, but this would not bee granted, for no body
would hazard his vessel and life for our sakes. Whilest we were thus distressed and perplexed
enquiring about <i>Granada</i> of the Merchants what course we might take to get
to <i>Spaine</i> that yeer, or to meet with the <i>Havana</i> or <i>Carthagena</i>, one that wished us well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
counselled us to goe to <i>Costarica</i>, where at <i>Carthago</i> we should be sure to hear of some
vessels bound for <i>Portobel</i>, either from the river called <i>de los Anzuelos</i>, or from the river
called <i>Suere</i>, from whence every yeer went out some small frigots to carry Meale,
Bacon, Fowles, and other provision for the Galeons to <i>Portobel</i>. This we thought
was a hard and difficult journey, and of neer a hundred and fifty leagues, over mountaines and
through desarts, where we should misse the pleasure, variety, and dainties of <i>Guatemala</i>
and <i>Nicaragua</i>, and after all this peradventure might misse of an opportunity
of any frigot bound to <i>Portobelo</i>. Yet so unwilling were we all to returne to <i>Guatemala</i>
from whence we came, that we would rather go forward, and undergoe any difficulties,
so that at last we might find any shipping to convey us where we might meet with
the Galeons, which we knew were not to come to <i>Portobel</i>, till the month of <i>June</i> or
<i>July</i>. We therefore agreed foure of us, three <i>Spaniards</i> and my selfe, to goe to <i>Costarica</i>,
and there to trie our fortune. They had each of them (as my selfe had)
carriage for one Mule, and none to ride on; but thought it their best way to buy each
of them a Mule to carry them, which they hoped after their journey to sell againe at
<i>Costarica</i>, and to get mony by them, and for their carriages to hire Mules and <i>Indians</i>
from Towne to Towne, who also might serve to guide us through many dangerous
places and passages, which we understood were in the way. Now I wished I had my
Mule which I sold at <i>San Miguel</i>, or any one of the two which I sold before in <i>Granada</i>.
But for my mony I doubted not, with the helpe of my <i>Black-more</i>, but I should
find one for my purpose. I furnished my selfe very speedily, for fifty peeces of eight,
of one which I feared not would performe my journey. My good and trusty <i>Black-more</i>
would willingly have gone on with me, and further round the world if I would
have permitted him; but I would not; but (thanked him heartily for what he
had done, and gave him money enough in his purse, and dismissed him) hoping that
the company of the three <i>Spaniards</i> would be sufficient comfort unto me.</p>

<p>Thus with one <i>Indian</i> to guide us we set four of us out of <i>Granada</i>, enjoying for
the two first daies more of the pleasure of that <i>Mahomets</i> paradise <i>Nicaragua</i>, finding
the way for the most part plain, the Townes pleasant, the Countrey shady, and every
where fruits abounding. The second day after we set out, we were much affrighted
with a huge and monstrous Caiman or Crocodile, which having come out of the
Lake (which we passed by) and lying crosse a puddle of water bathing himselfe, and
waiting for some prey, as we perceived after, whom we not knowing well at the first,
but thinking that it had been some tree that was felled or fallen, passed close by it; when
on a suddain we knew the scales of the Cayman, and saw the monster stir and move,
and set himself against us; wherewith we made hast from him; but he thinking to have
made some of us his greedy prey, ran after us, which when we perceived, and that he
was like to overtake us, we were much troubled, untill one of the <i>Spaniards</i> (who knew
better the nature &amp; quality of that Beast then the rest) called upon us to turn on one side
out of the way, and to ride on straight for a while, and then to turn on another side; and
so to circumflex our way, which advice of his without doubt saved mine, or some of
the others lives, for thus we wearied that mighty monster and escaped from him, who
(had we rid out straightway) had certainly overtaken us, and killed some mule or man,
for his straight forward flight was as swift as our Mules could run; but whilst he turned
and wheeled about his heavy body, we got ground and advantage till we left him far
behind us; and by this experience we came to know the nature and quality of that
beast, whose greatnesse of body is no hinderance to run forward as swift as a Mule;
but otherwise, as the Elephant once laid down is troubled to get up, so this monster
is heavy and stiffe, and therefore much troubled to turne and wind about his body. We
praised God who had that day delivered us, and riding for a while by the side of the
lake, we were watchful that we might not fall again into the like danger. But the greatnesse
of this lake of <i>Granada</i> may from hence be knowne, in that the second and third
day of our journey, being at least threescore miles from whence we set out, we now
and then found our way lying by it. After that wee had wholly lost the sight
of it, we began to enter into rough and craggy wayes, declining more to the South
then to the North sea. And in all the rest of our journey to <i>Carthago</i>, we observed
nothing worth committing to posterity, but onely mighty woods and trees on the
South sea side, very fit for to make strong ships, and many mountaines and desert places,
where we lay sometimes two nights together, either in woods or open fields, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
from any Town or habitation of <i>Indians</i>, yet for our comfort in these so desert places we
had stil a guide with us, and found lodges, which by the command of the neerest Justices
had been set up for such as travelled that way. We came at last through thousand dangers
to the city of <i>Carthago</i>, which we found not to be so poor as in richer places, as <i>Guatemala</i>
and <i>Nicaragua</i> it was reported to be. For there we had occasion to inquire after
some Merchants for exchange of gold and silver, and wee found that some were very
rich, who traded by Land and Sea with <i>Panama</i>, and by Sea with <i>Portobelo, Carthagena</i>,
and <i>Havana</i>, and from thence with <i>Spain</i>. This City may consist of foure hundred
Families, and is governed by a <i>Spanish</i> Governour; It is a Bishops Sea, and hath
in it three Cloisters, two of Fryers, and one of Nuns. Here we began to enquire after
that which had brought us through so many Mountaines, Woods and deserts, to
wit, after some speedy occasion of shipping our selves for <i>Portobelo</i> or <i>Carthagena</i>; and
according to our desires wee understood of one Frigat almost ready to set out from the
River called <i>De los Anzuelos</i>, and another from the River <i>Suere</i>; and being well informed
that <i>Suere</i> would bee the best place for us to Travaile unto by reason of more
provision in the way, more Towns of <i>Indians</i>, and Estancia's of <i>Spaniards</i>, we resolved
within foure dayes after wee had rested in <i>Carthago</i>, to undertake a new journey towards
the North Sea. Wee found that Country mountainous in many places, yet here and
there some Valleys where was very good corn, <i>Spaniards</i> living in good Farmes, who
as well as the <i>Indians</i> bred many hogs; but the Townes of <i>Indians</i> we found much
unlike to those which wee had left behind in <i>Nicaragua</i> and <i>Guatemala</i>; and the people
in curtesie and civility much differing from them, and of a rude and bold carriage
and behaviour towards us; yet they are kept under by the <i>Spaniards</i>, as much as those
whom I have formerly spoken of about <i>Guatemala</i>. Wee came in so good a time to
the River <i>Suere</i>, that wee stayed there but three dayes in a <i>Spanish</i> Farm neere unto it,
and departed.</p>

<p>The Master of the Frigat was exceeding glad of our company, and offered to carry
mee for nothing, but for my prayers to God for him, and for a safe passage; which
hee hoped would not bee above three or four daies sailing. What hee carried was nothing
but some Hony, Hides, Bacon, meal and fowles. The greatest danger he told us
of, was the setting out from the River, (which runs in some places with a very strong
stream, is shallow and full of rocks in other places) till wee come forth to the maine
Sea. Whither we got out safely and had not sailed on above twenty leagues, when we
discovered two ships making towards us; our hearts began to quake, and the Master
himselfe of the Frigat wee perceived was not without feare, who suspected that they
were <i>English</i>, or <i>Holland</i> Ships; wee had no guns nor weapons to fight with, save onely
foure or five Muskets and half a dozen Swords; wee thought the wings of our nimble
Frigat might be our best comfort, and flying away our chiefest safety. But this
comfort soon began to fail us, and our best safety was turned into neer approaching
danger; for before wee could flie on five leagues towards <i>Portobel</i>, wee could from our
Top Mast easily perceive the two Ships to be <i>Hollanders</i>, and too nimble for our little
Vessell, which presently one of them (which being a Man of Warre, was too much
and too strong for our weaknesse) fetcht up, and with a thundring Message made us
strike Saile. Without any fighting wee durst not but yeeld, hoping for better mercy.
But O what sad thoughts did here run to and fro my dejected heart, which was struck
down lower then our Saile? How did I sometimes look upon Deaths frighting visage?
But if again I would comfort and incourage my selfe against this feare of Death;
how then did I begin to see an end of all my hopes of ever more returning to my wished
and desired Country? How did I see that my treasure of Pearles, pretious Stones,
and peeces of Eight, and golden Pistols, which by singing I had got in twelve yeers
space, now within one halfe houre ready to be lost with weeping, and become a sure
prey to those who with as much ease as I got them, and with laughing were ready to
spoile mee of all that with the sound of Flutes, Waits and Organs I had so long been
hording up? Now I saw I must forcedly and fainedly offer up to a <i>Hollander</i> what superstitious,
yea also forced and fained offerings of <i>Indians</i> to their Saints of <i>Mixco,
Pinola, Amatitlan</i> and <i>Petapa</i> had for a while enriched mee. My further thoughts were
soone interrupted by the <i>Hollanders</i> who came abord our Frigat with more speed then
wee desired. Though their Swords, Muskets and Pistols did not a little terrifie, yet
wee were somewhat comforted, when wee understood who was their chief Captaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and Commander, and hoped for more mercy from him, who had been born and
brought up amongst <i>Spaniards</i>, then from the <i>Hollanders</i>, who as they were little bound
unto the <i>Spanish</i> Nation for mercy, so did wee expect little from them. The Captain
of this <i>Holland</i> Ship which took us was a Mulatto, born and bred in <i>Havana</i>, whose Mother
I saw and spoke with afterwards that same yeer, when the Galeons struck into
that Port to expect there the rest that were to come from <i>Vera Cruz</i>. This Mulatto
for some wrongs which had been offered unto him from some commanding <i>Spaniards</i>
in the <i>Havana</i>, ventured himself desperately in a boat out to the Sea, where were some
<i>Holland</i> Ships waiting for a prize, and with Gods helpe getting unto them, yeelded
himself to their mercy, which hee esteemed farre better then that of his own Country-men,
promising to serve them faithfully against his owne Nation, which had most injuriously
and wrongfully abused, yea and (as I was afterwards informed) whipped him
in the <i>Havana</i>.</p>

<p>This Mulatto proved so true and faithful in his good services unto the <i>Hollanders</i>,
that they esteemed much of him, marryed him to one of their Nation, and made him
Captain of a Ship under that brave and gallant <i>Hollander</i> whom the <i>Spaniards</i> then
so much feared, and named, <i>Pie de Palo</i>, or Woodden Leg. This famous Mulatto it
was that with his Sea Souldiers borded our Frigat, in the which hee had found little
worth his labour, had it not been for the <i>Indians</i> offerings which I carryed with mee,
of which I lost that day the worth of four thousand Patacons or peeces of eight in
pearles, and pretious stones, and neer three thousand more in money. The other
<i>Spaniards</i> lost some hundreds a peece, which was so rich a prize, that it made the <i>Hollanders</i>
stomach loath the rest of our grosse provision of Bacon, Meale and Fowles, and
our money tasted sweeter unto them, then the Hony which our Frigat also afforded
them. Other things I had (as a Quilt to lie on, some Bookes, and Lamina's, which
are pictures in brasse, and clothes) which I begged of that Noble Captaine the Mulatto,
who considering my Orders and calling, gave mee them freely, and wished me
to bee patient, saying that hee could doe no otherwise then he did with my mony and
Pearles, and using that common Proverbe at Sea, <i>Oy por mi, manana por ti</i>, to day
fortune hath been for mee, to morrow it may bee for thee: or to day I have got what
to morrow I may lose again. Here I made use also of that common saying, that il gotten
goods never thrive, and perceived it was the will of my heavenly Father to take from me
what so unlawfully by superstitious and idolatrous Masses, by Offerings unto Idols and
Statues of Saints I had got amongst the <i>Indians</i>. I offered in lieu of those former offerings
my will unto my Lord Gods will, desiring him to grant mee patience to bear that
great losse. I confesse, though it was very crosse to flesh and blood, yet I found an
inward spirituall strengthning from above, and to be very true what <i>Paul</i> writes to the
<i>Hebrews</i> in the 12 Chapter, and Verse 11. saying, <i>No chastening for the present seemeth to
bee joyous, but grievous; neverthelesse afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse
unto them which are exercised thereby</i>: for that very day I found my inward man
quiet and peaceable with a full and totall submission unto the holy will of God,
which I desired might bee done in earth, in the Sea, and performed and obeyed by me
at that present, as it is alwayes done in heaven. And although this was my best and
chief comfort, yet from the creature by the Creators permission I had also some comfort
left in a few pistols, some single, some double, which I had sowed up in
my Quilt (which the Captain restored unto mee, saying it was the bed I lay in) and
in the doublet which I had at that present, which mounted to almost a thousand
Crownes, and in their searching was not found out. After the Captain and Souldiers
had well viewed their prize, they thought of refreshing their stomacks with some
of our provision; the good Captaine made a stately dinner in our Frigat, and invited
mee unto it, and knowing that I was going towards the <i>Havana</i>, besides many other
brindi's or healths, hee drank one unto his mother, desiring mee to see her, and to remember
him unto her, and how that for her sake hee had used mee well and courteously
in what hee could; and further at Table hee said that for my sake hee would
give us our Frigat that wee might return again to land, and that I might find out from
thence some safer way and means to get to <i>Portobelo</i>, &amp; to continue on my journey unto
<i>Spain</i>. After dinner I conferred with the Captain alone, and told him that I was no
<i>Spaniard</i>, but an <i>English</i> man born, shewing him the Licence which I had from <i>Rome</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
goe to <i>England</i>, and that therefore I hoped, not being of an enemy nation to the
<i>Hollanders</i>, he would restore unto me what goods were mine. But all this was of little
consequence with him, who had already taken possession of mine, and all other
goods in the ship: he told me, I must suffer with those, amongst whom I was found,
and that I might as wel claime all the goods in the ship for mine. I desired him then to
carry me along with him to <i>Holland</i>, that from thence I might get to <i>England</i>, which
also he refused to doe, telling me that he went about from one place to another, and
knew not when he should goe to <i>Holland</i>, and that he was daily ready to fight with any
<i>Spanish</i> ship, and if he should fight with the <i>Spaniards</i> whilst I was in his ship, his
souldiers in their hot blood might be ready to doe me a mischiefe, thinking I would
doe them harm, if in fight they should be taken by the <i>Spaniards</i>. With these his answers
I saw there was no hope of getting againe what now was lost, therefore (as before)
I commended my selfe againe to Gods providence and protection. The Souldiers
and Mariners of the <i>Holland</i> ship, made hast that afternoone, to unlode the goods
of our Frigat into their Man of warre, which tooke them up that, and part of the next
day, whilst we as prisoners were wafting up and down the sea with them. And whereas
we thought our mony had satisfied them enough, and to the full, we found the next
day that they had also a stomack to our fowles and Bacon, and wanted our Meale to
make them bread, and our hony to sweeten their mouthes, and our Hydes for shooes
and bootes; all which they tooke away, leaving me my Quilt, Bookes, and brasse
pictures, and to the Master of the frigat some small provision, as much as might carry
us to land, which was not far off, and thus they tooke their leaves of us, thanking
us for their good entertainment. And we weary of such guests, some praying
to God that they might never entertaine the like againe, some cursing them all, and
especially the Mulatto to hell, calling him Renegado; some thanking God for their
lives which were given them for a prey, we all returned again to <i>Suere</i> from whence we
had set out, and going up the river, were almost like to bee cast away, and lose our
lives, after we had lost our goods. When we came to land, the <i>Spaniards</i> about the
Countrey pitied our case, and helped us with almes gathering a Collection for us. The
three <i>Spaniards</i> of my company lost all their mony and most of their best clothes, yet
they had reserved some bills of Exchange for money to be taken up at <i>Portobelo</i>; which
I wished I had also for what I had lost. For the present we knew not what
course to take; we thought of going to <i>Rio de los Anzuelos</i>, but we were informed
that certainly the frigats there were either gone, or would be gone before we could get
thither; and if they stayed not with the newes of the <i>Hollanders</i> ships at sea, they either
already were or would be their prize, as we had been. We resolved therefore with
the charitable assistance of the <i>Spaniards</i> about the Countrey to returne again to <i>Carthago</i>,
and from thence to take some better directions. In the way we conferred what
we had saved, the <i>Spaniards</i> bragged yet of their bills of Exchange, which would
yeeld them mony at <i>Carthago</i>, I would not let them know what I had saved, but somewhat
I told them I had kept; and we agreed all the way we went to signifie nothing
but poverty and misery, that the <i>Indians</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> in the way might pitty and
commiserate us, and our great losses. When we came to <i>Carthago</i> we were indeed
much pittied, and Collections were made for us; and as it was expected from mee,
that I should sing againe at the Altars (who truely could rather have cried to see and
consider my many misfortunes and disasters, which I desired might at last by a safe returne
to <i>England</i>, prove the trials of the faith I intended to search out) and that I
should preach wheresoever I came; so by these two waies, of singing and of hudling
over <i>Dominus vobiscum</i> and the rest of the Masse, and by accepting of what Sermons
were recommended unto me, I began againe to store my selfe with monies. Yet
I knew that in such a poore Countrey as that was, where I was little knowne, I could
not possibly get enough to bring me home with credit into <i>England</i>, and therefore the
cunning enemy finding me to stand upon my credit, began strongly to tempt me to returne
againe to <i>Guatemala</i> (where I doubted not but I should be welcomed and entertained
by my friends) and to settle my selfe there, untill I had againe by sacrilegious,
base, superstitious, and idolatrous means, and works, made up a new purse to
returne with credit home.</p>

<p>But I perceiving that God already had shewed himselfe angry, and justly taken from
me, what by unlawfull meanes I had in twelve yeers obtained, bad Satan avaunt, purposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
never more to returne to the flesh pots of <i>Egypt</i>, and to goe still home-wards,
though in the way I did beg my bread. Yet (lest I might be suspected amongst the
<i>Spaniards</i>, and troubled for not exercising my orders and function) I resolved to take
what as to a stranger and traveller for preaching or any other exercise might be offered
unto me.</p>

<p>Thus with courage resolving to goe on still towards <i>England</i>, I enquired at <i>Carthago</i>
which way I might get to <i>Portobelo</i>. But this doore of hope was fast shut up; though
my trust in Gods providence was not weakened. In this season, there came to <i>Carthago</i>
some two or three hundred Mules unsadled or unloaden with some <i>Spaniards, Indians</i>,
and <i>Black-mores</i>, from the parts of <i>Comayagua</i> and <i>Guatemala</i> to convey them
to <i>Panama</i> by land, over the mountaines of <i>Veragua</i> there to be sold. This is the yeerly
and onely trading by land, which <i>Guatemala, Comayagua</i>, and <i>Nicaragua</i>, hath
with <i>Panama</i> over that narrow <i>Isthmus</i> lying between the North, and South sea,
which is very dangerous by reason of the craggy waies, rockes, and mountaines, but
more especially, by reason of many Heathens, Barbarians and savage people, which as
yet are not conquered by the <i>Spaniards</i>, and sometimes do great hurt and mischief, and
kill those that with Mules passe through their Countrey, especially if they misdemean
themselves, or please them not well. Yet for all these difficulties, I was entertaining a
thought to go along with those Mules and <i>Spaniards</i>, which were now on their way by
land to <i>Panama</i>. The three <i>Spaniards</i> were halfe of the same mind; but the providence of
God who better ordereth and disposeth mans affaires then he himselfe, disappointed
these our thoughts for our good and safety, as after we were informed; for we heard
for certain at <i>Nicoya</i>, that some of those Mules and <i>Spaniards</i> were killed by the <i>Barbarians</i>
and savage <i>Indians</i>, amongst whom my life might have been lost, if I had attempted
that hard and dangerous journey; from which many well wishers at <i>Carthago</i> did
disswade me, both for the danger of the <i>Indians</i>, and for the difficulties of the waies and
mountaines, which they told me the weakenesse of my body would never indure. After
we had wholly desisted from this Land journey, the best counsell, that we had from
some Merchants our friends, was to try whether <i>Mar del Zur</i>, or the South sea, would
favour our designe and journey, better then the <i>Mar del Norte</i>, or the North sea had
done; who wished us to goe to <i>Nicoya</i>, and from thence to <i>Chira</i>, and to the <i>Golfo de
Salinas</i>, where they doubted not but we should find shipping to <i>Panama</i>. Wee were
willing to follow any good advise and counsell; yet we knew that this was the last shift
which we could make, and the <i>non plus ultra</i> of our hopes, and that if here we should be
disappointed, we could expect no other way ever to get to <i>Panama</i>, except we should
venture our lives most desperately over the mountaines of <i>Veragua</i>, and by land without
any guide or company through the Countrey of the Barbarians, (who before
had slaine some <i>Spaniards</i> passing that way) or else should returne againe, all the way
that we had come, to <i>Realejo</i>, where our hopes might be frustrated, and peradventure
no shipping found for <i>Panama</i>, without a yeers waiting for it.</p>

<p>We resolved therefore to follow this our friends counsell, and to goe yet to <i>Nicoya</i>,
and from thence to <i>Golfo de Salinas</i>, where laughing, I told the three <i>Spaniards</i> of my
company, that if we were disappointed, we would like <i>Hercules</i> set up a Pillar to eternize
our fame, with our names, and this inscription upon it, <i>Non plus Ultra</i>, for
that beyond it there was no other Port, Haven, or place, to take shipping to <i>Panama</i>;
neither could any man have done more (nor ever did any <i>English</i> man in that Countrey
doe more then my selfe) then wee had done, but especially my selfe, who from
<i>Mexico</i> had thus travelled by land to <i>Nicoya</i> at lead six hundred leagues, or eighteen
hundred <i>English</i> miles straight from North to South, besides what I had travelled from
<i>Vera Cruz</i> to <i>Mexico</i>, and from <i>Guatemala</i> to <i>Vera Paz</i>, and to <i>Puerto de Cavallos</i>, or
<i>Golfo dulce</i>, and from thence to <i>Truxillo</i>, and from thence back againe to <i>Guatemala</i>,
which was at least thirteen or fourteen hundred <i>English</i> miles more, which I thought to
eternize upon a pillar at <i>Nicoya</i>. But what there was not erected, I hope here shall be
eternized, and that this my true and faithfull History shall bee a Monument of three
thousand, and three hundred miles travelled by an <i>English</i> man, within the main land of
<i>America</i>, besides other sea navigations to <i>Panama</i>, from <i>Portobel</i> to <i>Carthagena</i>, and from
thence unto the <i>Havana</i>. The way which we travelled from <i>Carthago</i> to <i>Nicoya</i> was very
mountainous, hard, &amp; unpleasant, for we met with few Estancia's of <i>Spaniards</i>, and few
<i>Indian</i> Towns, and those very poor, smal, and all of dejected and wretched people. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<i>Nicoya</i> is a pretty Towne, and head of a <i>Spanish</i> government, where wee found one
<i>Justo de Salazar</i>, Alcalde Maior, who entertained us very well, and provided lodgings
for us for the time that wee should abide there, and comforted us with hopeful
words, that though for the present there was no ship or frigat in the Golfe of <i>Salinas</i>,
yet he doubted not, but very shortly one would come from <i>Panama</i> thither, for Salt
and other commodities, as yeerly they were wont. The time of the yeer when we came
thither, was a fit time for me to get againe some monies after my great losse; for it was
in Lent which is the Friers chiefest harvest, who (as I have before observed) then by
Confessions and by giving the Communion get many money offerings.</p>

<p>The time, and the Franciscan Frier who had the Pastorship and charge of that
Towne, were both very commodious unto me, who could not refuse as long as I stayed
there to exercise my function, lest I should bring a just cause of suspition and aspersion
upon my selfe. The Frier of the Towne was a <i>Portingal</i>, who about three weeks
before my comming thither had had a very great bickering and strife with <i>Justo de Salazar</i>
the Alcalde Maior, for defending the <i>Indians</i>, whom <i>Salazar</i> did grievously
oppresse, employing them in his, and his wifes service as slaves, and not paying them
what for the sweat of their browes was due unto them, and commanding them to be
from their home and from their wives, and from their Church upon the Sabbath,
working for him as well that day as any other. Which the Frier not enduring, charged
them in the pulpit, not to obey any such unlawfull commands from their Alcalde
Maior. But <i>Justo de Salazar</i> (who had been trained up in warres and fighting, and
had served formerly in the Castle of <i>Milan</i>) thought it a great disparagement unto him,
now to be curbed by a Frier, and by such a one to be interrupted in his government of
the <i>Indians</i>, and in the waies of his owne lucre and gaine. Therefore after many bitter
words and defiances, which had passed between him and the Frier, he came one
day resolutely to the Friers house with his sword drawne; and certainly had not the
Frier been assisted by some of the <i>Indians</i>, he had killed him. The Frier being as hot
as he, and standing upon his calling, Orders, and Preisthood, presuming that hee
durst not touch him violently, lest his priviledge should bring an excommunication upon
the striker and offendour, would not flie from him, but dared him boldly; which
was a strong provocation to <i>Salazars</i> heat and passion, and caused him to lift up his
sword, and aime his blow and stroke at the Frier, which fell so unhappily that with
it he strucke of two of the Friers fingers, and had undoubtedly seconded another blow
more hurtfull and dangerous to the Frier, had not the <i>Indians</i> interposed themselves,
and shut up their Preist into his chamber. <i>Justo</i> was for this action excommunicated,
yet for that he was a man of high authority, he soone got off his excommunication
from the Bishop of <i>Costarica</i> and sent his complaint to the Chancery of <i>Guatemala</i>
against the Frier, where with friends and mony he doubted not but to overcome the
Mendicant Preist, as it happened after; for (as I was informed) hee caused the Frier
to be sent for up to the Court, and there prevailed so much against him, that he got
him to be removed from <i>Nicoya</i>. In this season the Frier kept his house and chamber,
and would by no means goe out to the Church, either to say Masse, or to preach, or
hear Confessions, (all which that time of the yeer did require of him) but had got
one to helpe him; who alone not being able to performe so great a charge of many
hundred <i>Indians, Spaniards, Black-mores</i>, and <i>Mulatto's</i>, who from the Countrey
without, and from the Towne within expected to have their Confessions heard, their
sins absolved, the word preached, and the Communion to be given them; hearing of
my comming desired me to assist and helpe him, and that for my paines I should have
my meat and drinke at his table, and a Crowne daily for every Masse, and whatsoever
else the people should voluntarily offer, besides the Sermons, which should be well rewarded
unto me. I staied in this Towne from the second week of Lent untill Easter
weeke, where what with three Sermons at ten Crownes a peece, what with my daily
stipend and many other offerings, I got about an hundred and fifty Crownes.</p>

<p>The weeke before Easter newes came of a frigat from <i>Panama</i> to <i>Golfo de Salinas</i>,
which much comforted us, who already began to mistrust the delay. The Master of the
frigat came to <i>Nicoya</i>, which is as Court thereabouts; and with him the three <i>Spaniards</i>
and my selfe agreed for our passage to <i>Panama</i>. About <i>Chira, Golfo de Salinas</i>, and
<i>Nicoya</i>, there are some farmes of <i>Spaniards</i>, few and very small <i>Indian</i> Townes, who
are all like slaves employed by the Alcalde Maior, to make him a kind of thred called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Pita, which is a very rich Commodity in <i>Spain</i>, especially of that colour wherewith
it is dyed in these parts of <i>Nicoya</i>, which is a purple colour; for the which the <i>Indians</i>
are here much charged to work about the Sea shore, and there to finde out certain shels,
wherewith they make this purple dye.</p>

<p>There are also shels for other colours, which are not knowne to be so plentifully in
any other place as here. About <i>Chira</i> and <i>Golfo de Salinas</i> the chief commodities are
Salt, Hony, Maiz, some Wheat and Fowles, which every yeer they send by some few
Frigats to <i>Panama</i>, which from thence come on purpose to fetch them with this purple
coloured thred, or <i>Pita</i>, which I have spoken of. The Frigat which came when
I was there, was soon laden with these Commodities, and with it we set out hoping to
have been at <i>Panama</i> within five or six dayes. But as often before we had been crossed,
so likewise in this short passage wee were striving with the Wind, Sea, and Corrientes,
as they are called (which are swift streames as of a River) foure full weekes. After
the first day that wee set out, wee were driven with a wind and storme towards <i>Peru</i>,
till wee came under the very Æquinoctiall line, where what with excessive heat, what
with mighty stormes, we utterly despaired of life. But after one week that we had thus
run towards death, it pleased God in whom and by whom all creatures live, move, and
have their being, to comfort us againe with hopes of life, sending us a prosperous gale,
which drove us out of that Æquinoctiall heat, and stormy Sea, towards the Islands of
<i>Perlas</i> and <i>Puerta de Chame</i>, lying on the South side of the Mountaines of <i>Veragua</i>, from
whence wee hoped within two dayes at the most, to be at rest and Anchor at <i>Panama</i>.
But yet these our hopes were frustrated, for there our wind was calmed, and we fell upon
those strong Corrientes or streams, which drave us back in the night for the space
of almost a fortnight as much as wee had sailed in the day. Had not God againe been
merciful here unto us, we had certainly perished in this our striving with the stream; for
although wee wanted not provision of food, yet our drink failed us so, that for foure
dayes wee tasted neither drop of wine or water, or any thing that might quench our
thirst, save onely a little hony which wee found did cause more thirst in us, which made
mee and some others to drink our own Urine, and to refresh our mouthes with peeces
of lead bullets, which did for a while refresh, but would not long have sufficed Nature,
had not Gods good Providence sent us such a wind which in the day drave us quite
off from those Corrientes. Our first thoughts were then to strike either to the Continent, or
some Island of many which were about us to seek for water, finding our bodies
weak and languishing; which the Captaine of the Ship would by no meanes yeeld unto,
assuring us that that day hee would land us at <i>Panama</i>; but wee not being able to
saile on without drink, unlesse wee should yeeld to have our dead and not live bodies
landed where hee promised, thought it no good purchase though we might buy all
<i>Panama</i> with our lives, which wee judged could not hold out another day; and seeing
that the wind began to slacken, we all required him to strike into some Island for water;
which he stubbornly refused and denyed to doe; whereupon the three <i>Spaniards</i> and
some of the Mariners mutinied against him with drawn Swords, threatning to kill him
if he betooke not himselfe presently to some Island. The good Master thought it bad
sport to see Swords at his breast, and so commanded his Ship to bee turned to two or
three Islands, which were not above two or three houres sail from us. When we drew
nigh unto them, wee cast our Anchor, and our Cock-boat, and happy was hee that
could first cast himself into it to be rowed to land to fill his belly with water. The
first Island wee landed upon, was on that side unhabitable, where wee spent much time
running to and fro, over heating our selves and increasing our thirst; thus whilst one
ran one way, and another tryed another to find out some fountain, our hopes being
frustrated and I lost in the Wood, and my shooes torne from my feet, with stony rocks,
and many thornes and bushes in other places; my company betook themselves to the
Cock-boat to try another Island, leaving mee alone, and lost in the Wood; out
of which at last when I came, and found the Cock-boat gone from the shore, I began
to consider myself a dead man, thinking that they had found water and were gone
to Ship, and not finding mee would hoise up their sailes for <i>Panama</i>. Thus being
dejected I cryed out to the Ship, which I perceived could not possibly hear my weak
voyce, and running up and down the Rocks to see if I could discover the Cock-boat,
I perceived it was not with the Ship, and espied it at the next Island. With this I began
to hope better things of them that they would call for mee when they had gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
water; so I came down from the Rocks to the plain shore, where I found a shade of
trees and amongst them some berries (which might have been poison, for I knew
them not) wherewith I refreshed my mouth for a while; but my body so burned that
I thought there with heat, weaknesse and faintnesse I should have expired and given up
the Ghost. I thought by stripping my selfe naked and going into the Sea unto my
neck, I might thus refresh my body, which I did, and comming out againe into the
shade, I fell into a deep sleep, in so much that the Cock-boat comming for mee, and
the company hollowing unto mee, I awaked not, which made them feare that I was
dead or lost; till landing, one searched for mee one way, and another another, and
so they found me, who might have been a prey to some wild Beast, or slept till the Frigat
had gone away, and so have perished in a barren and unhabitable Island. When they
awaked mee, I was glad to see my good company, and the first thing I enquired for,
was, if they had got any water; they bad mee bee of good cheere and arise, for they
had water enough, and Oranges and Lemmons from another Island, where they met
with <i>Spaniards</i> that did inhabit it. I made haste with them to the Boat, and no sooner
was I entred into it, but they gave mee to drink as much as I would. The water was
warme and unsetled, for they could not take it up so but that they tooke of the gravell
and bottome of the Fountain, which made it look very muddy; yet for all this (as
though my life had depended upon it) I drank up a whole pot of it; which no sooner
had I dranke, but such was the weaknesse of my stomack that it presently cast it up againe
not being able to beare it. With this they wished me to eat an Orange or a Lemmon;
but them also did my stomack reject; so to our Frigat wee went, and in the
way I fainted so that the company verily thought I would die, before wee got aboard.
When wee came thither I called againe for water, which was no sooner downe my stomack,
but presently up again; they had mee to bed with a burning Feaver upon mee;
where I lay that night expecting nothing but death, and that the Sea should bee my
grave.</p>

<p>The Master of the Ship seeing the wind was turned, began to bee much troubled, and
feared that with that wind he should never get to <i>Panama</i>. He resolved to venture upon
a way, which never before hee had tryed; which was, to get between the two Islands
which wee had searched for water, knowing that the wind, which on this side was
contrary, on the other side of the Islands would bee favourable unto him. Thus towards
the Evening hee tooke up Anchor and hoised up his sailes, and resolved to passe
his Frigat between the two Islands; which how dangerous and desperate an attempt it
was, the event witnessed. I lay in this season (as I may truely say) upon my death bed, not
regarding which way the Master of the Ship, or fortune carried mee, so that the mercy
of the Lord carryed my soule to heaven. No sooner had the Frigat steered her course
between the narrow passage of the two Islands, when being carryed with the stream
too much to the one side of the land it ran upon a Rock; so that the very stern was lifted
up, and almost call out of the Pilots hands, who cryed out not to God, but unto
the Virgin <i>Mary</i> saying, <i>Ayudad nos Virgen Santissima, que si no aqui nos perecemos</i>, help
us, O most holy Virgin, for if not, here we perish. This, and the outcry of all that
were in the Frigat gave unto mee an Alarm of death; from the which yet it pleased
God by the meanes and diligence of the painefull Mariners to deliver mee and all the
Company, for with much adoe most part of that night they haled from the Cock-boat
the Frigat off from the Rock, after the streame had made it three severall times to
strike upon it. After a very troublesome night in the morning wee got our little Ship
out of all danger and from between the two Islands on the other side of them, where
wee sailed prosperously towards <i>Panama</i>. That morning my stomack recovered some
of its lost strength, and I began to eat and to drink, and to walk about, rejoycing much
to see those pleasant Islands which wee sailed by. In the Evening wee got to <i>Puerto de
Perico</i>; where wee cast Anchor, expecting to bee searched in the morning; but that
night (the Master of our Ship having gone to shore) the wind turned and blew so strong
that wee lost our Anchor, and and were driven back almost to <i>la Pacheque</i> and feared
wee should bee carried out into the Ocean againe so farre that we should with great difficulty
get to <i>Panama</i>. But that God whom the Sea and winds doe obey, turned againe
that contrary wind into a prosperous gale, wherewith wee came once more unto <i>Perico</i>;
and being searched wee went on with full sail to <i>Panama</i>; Being neere the Port and
without an Anchor in our Ship the wind once more blew us back and had not the Ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Master sent us an Anchor, we had gon againe to <i>Pacheque</i> or further. But with that
anchor we stayed all that night at <i>Perico</i>, wondring among our selves that so many
crosses should befall us, which made some say that we were bewitched; others, that
certainly there was amongst us some excommunicated person, whom they said if they
knew of, they would hurle him over bord. Whilst they were in this discourse, the wind
turned yet againe, and we levying our anchor went on to <i>Panama</i>, whither it pleased
God that time safely to conduct us in. I being now well strengthened made no stay in
that frigat, which I thought would have been my last abiding place in this world, but
went to land, and betooke my selfe to the Cloister of the Dominicans, where I stayed
almost fifteen daies viewing and reviewing that City; which is governed like <i>Guatemala</i>
by a President and six Judges, and a Court of Chancery, and is a Bishops sea. It
hath more strength towards the South sea, then any other Port which on that side I
had seen, and some Ordnances planted for the defence of it; but the houses are of the
least strength of any place that I had entred in; for lime and stone is hard to come by,
and therefore for that reason, and for the great heat there, most of the houses are built
of timber and bords; the Presidents house, nay the best Church walls are but bords,
which serve for stone and bricke, and for tiles to cover the top. The heat is so extraordinary
that a linnen cut doublet, with some slight stuffe or taffetie breeches is the
common cloathing of the inhabitants. Fish, fruits and herbage for sallets is more
plentifull there then flesh; the coole water of the Coco is the womens best drinke,
though Chocolatte also, and much wine from <i>Peru</i> be very abounding. The <i>Spaniards</i>
are in this City much given to sinne, loosenesse and venery especially, who make
the <i>Black-mores</i>, (who are many, rich, and gallant) the chiefe objects of their lust.
It is held to be one of the richest places in all <i>America</i>, having by land and by the river
<i>Chiagre</i> commerce with the North sea, and by the South, trading with all <i>Peru, East-India's,
Mexico</i>, and <i>Honduras</i>. Thither is brought the chiefe treasure of <i>Peru</i> in
two or three great ships, which lie at anchor at <i>Puerto de Perico</i> some three leagues from
the City; for the great ebbing of the sea at that place especially suffereth not any great
vessell to come neerer, where daily the sea ebbs and falls away from the City two or
three miles, leaving a mud, which is thought to cause much unhealthinesse in that place,
being seconded with many other muddy and moorish places about the Town. It consisteth of
some five thousand inhabitants, and maintaineth at least eight Cloisters of
Nuns and Friers. I feared much the heats, and therefore made as much haste out of it
as I could. I had my choice of company by land and water to <i>Portobelo</i>. But considering
the hardnesse of the mountaines by land, I resolved to goe by the river <i>Chiagre</i>;
and so at midnight I set out from <i>Panama</i> to <i>Venta de Cruzes</i>, which is ten or twelve
leagues from it. The way is thither very plaine for the most part, and pleasant in the
morning and evening.</p>

<p>Before ten of the clock we got to <i>Venta de Cruzes</i>, where live none but <i>Mulatto's</i> and
<i>Black-mores</i>, who belong unto the flat boates that carry the merchandize to <i>Portobel</i>.
There I had very good entertainment by that people, who desired me to preach unto
them the next Sabbath day, and gave me twenty Crownes for a Sermon, and procession.
After five daies of my abode there, the boats set out, which were much stopped
in their passage downe the river; for in some places we found the water very low,
so that the boats ran upon the gravell; from whence with poles and the strength of the
<i>Black-mores</i> they were to be lifted off againe; sometimes again we met with such streams
that carried us with the swiftnesse of an arrow downe under trees and boughes by the
river side, which sometimes also stopped us till we had cut downe great branches of
trees. Had not it pleased God to send us after the first weeke plentifull raine, which
made the water run downe from the mountaines and fill the river (which otherwise
of it selfe is very shallow) we might have had a tedious and longer passage; but after
twelve daies we got to the sea, and at the point landed at the Castle to refresh our selves
for halfe a day. Certainly the <i>Spaniards</i> trust to the streames and shallownesse of that
river, which they thinke will keep off any forain nation, from attempting to come up
to <i>Venta de Cruzes</i> and from thence to <i>Panama</i>, or else they would strengthen more
and fortifie that Castle, which in my time wanted great reparations, and was ready to
fall downe to the ground. The Governour of the Castle was a notable wine-bibber,
who plyed us with that liquor the time that we stayed there, and wanting a Chaplain
for himselfe, and Souldiers, would faine have had me stayed with him; but greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
matters called me further, and so I tooke my leave of him, who gave us some dainties
of fresh meat, fish, and conserves, and so dismissed us. We got out to the open
sea, discovering first the <i>Escudo de Veragua</i>, and keeping somewhat close unto the
land we went on rowing towards <i>Portobel</i>, till the evening which was Saturday night;
then we cast anchor behind a little Island, resolving in the morning to enter in <i>Portobel</i>.
The <i>Black-mores</i> all that night kept watch for fear of <i>Hollanders</i>, whom they said did
often lie in wait thereabouts for the boats of <i>Chiagre</i>; but we passed the night safely,
and next morning got to <i>Portobelo</i>, whose haven we observed to be very strong with
two Castles at the mouth and constant watch within them, and another called <i>St. Miguel</i>
further in the Port.</p>

<p>When I came into the Haven I was sorry to see that as yet the Galeons were not
come from <i>Spaine</i>, knowing that the longer I stayed in that place, greater would be my
charges. Yet I comforted my selfe that the time of the yeer was come, and that they
could not long delay their coming. My first thoughts were of taking up a lodging,
which at that time were plentifull and cheape, nay some were offered me for nothing
with this caveat, that when the Galeons did come, I must either leave them, or pay a
dear rate for them. A kind Gentleman, who was the Kings Treasurer, falling in
discourse with me promised to helpe me, that I might be cheaply lodged even when the
ships came, and lodgings were at the highest rate. Hee, interposing his authority, went
with me to seeke one, which at the time of the fleets being there, might continue to be
mine. It was no bigger then would containe a bed, a table, and a stoole or two, with
roome enough besides to open and shut the doore, and they demanded of me for it
during the foresaid time of the Fleet, sixcore Crownes, which commonly is a fortnight.
For the Towne being little, and the Souldiers, that come with the Galeons
for their defence at least four or five thousand; besides Merchants from <i>Peru</i>, from <i>Spain</i>
and many other places to buy and sell, is the cause that every roome, though never
so small be dear; and sometimes all the lodgings in the Towne are few enough for so
many people, which at that time doe meet at <i>Portobel</i>. I knew a Merchant who gave a
thousand Crownes for a shop of reasonable bignesse, to sell his wares and commodities
that yeer that I was there, for fifteen daies only, which the Fleet continued to be in that
Haven. I thought it much for me to give the sixcore Crownes which were demanded
of me for a room, which was but as a mouse hole, and began to be troubled, and told
the Kings Treasurer that I had been lately robbed at sea, and was not able to give so
much, and bee besides at charges for my diet, which I feared would prove as much
more. But not a farthing would be abated of what was asked; whereupon the good
Treasurer pitying me, offered to the man of the house to pay him threescore Crowns
of it, if so be that I was able to pay the rest, which I must doe, or else lie without in the
street. Yet till the Fleet did come I would not enter into this deare hole, but accepted
of another faire lodging which was offered me for nothing. Whilest I thus expected
the Fleets coming, some mony and offerings I got for Masses, and for two Sermons
which I preached at fifteen Crownes a peece. I visited the Castles, which indeed
seemed unto me to be very strong; but what most I wondred at was to see the requa's
of Mules which came thither from <i>Panama</i>, laden with wedges of silver; in one
day I told two hundred Mules laden with nothing else, which were unladen in the
publicke Market place, so that there the heapes of silver wedges lay like heaps of stones
in the street, without any feare or suspition of being lost. Within ten daies the fleet
came, consisting of eight Galeons and ten Merchant ships, which forced me to run to
my hole. It was a wonder then to see the multitude of people in those streets which
the weeke before had been empty.</p>

<p>Then began the price of all things to rise, a fowl to be worth twelve Rials, which in
the main land within I had often bought for one; a pound of beefe then was worth
two Rialls, whereas I had had in other places thirteen pound for half a Riall, and so of
all other food and provision, which was so excessive dear, that I knew not how to live
but by fish and Tortoises, which there are very many, and though somewhat deare,
yet were the cheapest meat that I could eate. It was worth seeing how Merchants sold
their commodities, not by the Ell or yard, but by the piece and weight, not paying in
coined peeces of mony, but in wedges which were weighed and taken for commodities.
This lasted but fifteen dayes, whilst the Galeons were lading with wedges of
silver and nothing else; so that for those fifteen daies, I dare boldly say and avouch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that in the world there is no greater Fair then that of <i>Portobel</i>, between the <i>Spanish</i>
Merchants and those of <i>Peru, Panama</i>, and other parts thereabouts.</p>

<p>Whilest this traffique was, it happened unto me, that which I have formerly testified
in my Recantation Sermon at <i>Pauls</i> Church, which if by that meanes it have not
come unto the knowledge of many, I desire again to record it in this my History, that
to all <i>England</i> it may be published; which was, that one day saying Masse in the chiefe
Church, after the Consecration of the bread, being with my eyes shut at that mentall
prayer, which the Church of <i>Rome</i> calleth the <i>Memento</i> for their dead, there came from
behind the Altar a mouse, which running about, came to the very bread or wafer God of
the Papists, and taking it in his mouth ran away with it, not being perceived by any
of the people who were at Masse, for that the Altar was high by reason of the steps going
up to it, and the people farre beneath. But as soone as I opened my eyes to goe
on with my Masse, and perceived my God stollen away, I looked about the Altar, and
saw the mouse running away with it; which on a suddain did so stupifie me, that I
knew not well what to doe or say, and calling my wits together, I thought that if I
should take no notice of the mischance, and any body else in the Church should, I
might justly be questioned by the Inquisition; but if I should call to the people to look
for the Sacrament, then I might bee but chid and rebuked for my carelessenesse; which
of the two I thought would be more easily borne, then the rigour of the Inquisition.
Whereupon not knowing what the people had seen, I turned my selfe unto them, and
called them unto the Altar, and told them plainely, that whilest I was in my <i>Memento</i>
prayers and meditations, a mouse had carried away the Sacrament, and that I knew not
what to doe, unlesse they would helpe me to find it out again. The people called a
Priest that was at hand, who presently brought in more of his Coat; and as if their
God by this had been eaten up they presently prepared themselves to find out the thief,
as if they would eat up the mouse that had so assaulted and abused their God; they
lighted candles and torches to find out the Malefactour in his secret and hidden places
of the wall; and after much searching and enquiry for the sacrilegious beast, they
found at last in a hole of the wall the Sacrament halfe eaten up; which with great joy
they took out, and as if the Arke had been brought again from the <i>Philistines</i> to the
<i>Israelites</i>, so they rejoyced for their new found God, whom with many people now
resorted to the Church, with many lights of candles and Torches, with joyfull and
solemne musicke they carried about the Church in procession. My selfe was present
upon my knees, shaking and quivering for what might be done unto mee, and expecting
my doome and judgement; and as the Sacrament passed by me, I observed in it
the markes and signes of the teeth of the mouse, as they are to bee seen in a piece of
cheese gnawne and eaten by it.</p>

<p>This struck mee with such horrour, that I cared not at that present whether I had
been torne in a thousand peices for denying publickely that Mouse-eaten God,
I called to my best memory all Philosophy concerning substance and accidents, and resolved
within my selfe that what I saw gnawne, was not an accident, but some reall
substance eaten and devoured by that vermin, which certainly was fed and nourished
by what it had eaten, and Philosophy well teacheth; <i>substantia Cibi (non accidentis) convertitur
in substantiam alii</i>, the substance (not the accident,) of the food or meat is converted,
and turned into the substance of the thing fed by it and alimented; Now here
I knew that this Mouse had fed upon some substance, or else how could the markes of
the teeth so plainely appeare? But no Papist will bee willing to answer that it fed upon
the substance of Christs Body, <i>ergo</i> by good consequence it followes that it fed upon
the substance of bread; and so Transubstantiation here in my judgement was confuted
by a Mouse; which meane and base creature God chose to convince mee of my
former errours, and made mee now resolve upon what many yeeres before I had doubted,
that certainly the point of Transubstantiation taught by the Church of <i>Rome</i> is most
damnable and erroneous; for besides, what before I have observed, it contradicteth
that Philosophicall Axiome, teaching that <i>duo contradictoria non possunt simul &amp; semel de
eodem verificari</i>, two contradictories cannot at once and at the self same time be said, and
verified of the same thing; but here it was so; for here in <i>Romes</i> Judgement and opinion
Christs body was gnawne and eaten, and at the same time the same body in another
place and upon another Altar in the hands of another Preist was not eaten and
gnawne, Therefore here are two contradictories verified of the same body of Christ:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to wit, it was eaten and gnawne, and it was not eaten and gnawne. These impressions
at that time were so great in me, that I resolved within my selfe, that bread really and
truely was eaten upon that Altar, and by no meanes Christs glorious body which is in
heaven, and cannot be upon earth, subject to the hunger or violence of a creature.
Here againe I desired with godly <i>David</i>, that I might have the wings of a Dove to flie
into my Country of <i>England</i>, and there be satisfied upon this point, and be at rest of
Conscience. Here I resolved that if I had been questioned for my carelessenesse, or
for my contempt of that Romish Sacrament (which I thought would be the judgement
of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who knew me to be an <i>English</i> man borne) that I would sacrifice
willingly my life for the Protestant truth, which as yet I had been no otherwise
taught, but by that Spirit which (as <i>Solomon</i> well observeth) in a man is the candle
of the Lord. I conceived here that this was some comfort to my soule, which my good
God would afford mee in the way of my travelling to <i>Canaan</i>, that I might more willingly
beare whatsoever crosses yet might befall mee in my way and Journey to <i>England</i>.
The event of this accident was not any trouble that fell upon mee for it; for
indeed the <i>Spaniards</i> attributed it unto the carelessnesse of him, who had care of the
Altars in the Church, and not to any contempt in mee to the Sacrament. The part
of the wafer that was left after the Mouse had filled her belly, was laid up after the Solemne
Procession about the Church, in a Tabernacle for that purpose, that afterwards
it might be eaten up by some hungry Preist. And because such a high contempt had
beene offered by a contemptible Vermin to their Bread God, it was commanded
through <i>Portabel</i> that day, that all the people should humble themselves and mourn,
and fast with bread and water onely. Although I saw I was not questioned for the
case, yet I feared where there were so many Souldiers, and forain people, that by
some or other I might bee mischiefed out of their blind zeale, wherefore I thought
it not amisse for a day or two to keepe within my lodging. <i>Don Carlos de Ybarra</i>,
who was the Admirall of that Fleet, made great haste to bee gone; which made the
Merchants buy and sell apace, and lade the ships with silver wedges; whereof I was
glad, for the more they laded, the lesse I unladed my purse with buying deare provision,
and sooner I hoped to be out of that unhealthy place, which of it selfe is very hot,
and subject to breed Feavers, nay death, if the feet bee not preserved from wetting
when it raineth; but especially when the Fleet is there, it is an open grave ready
to swallow in part of that numerous people, which at that time resort unto it, as
was seene the yeare that I was there when about five hundred of the Souldiers, Merchants,
and Mariners, what with Feavers, what with the Flux caused by too much
eating of fruit and drinking of water, what with other disorders lost their lives, finding
it to bee to them not <i>Porto bello</i>, but <i>Porto malo</i>. And this is usuall every yeare;
and therefore for the reliefe and comfort of those that come sick from Sea, or sicken
there, a great and rich Hospitall is in the Towne, with many Fryers called <i>De la
Capacha</i>, or by others <i>De Juan de Dios</i>, whose calling and profession is onely to cure,
and attend upon the sick, and to beare the dead unto their graves. The Admirall
fearing the great sicknesse that yeare, made haste to be gone, not fearing the report that
was of some three or four <i>Holland</i> or <i>English</i> ships abroad at Sea, waiting (as it was supposed)
for some good prize out of that great and rich Fleet. This news made mee
beginne to feare, and to thinke of securing my selfe in one of the best and strongest
Galeons; but when I came to treat of my passage in one of them, I found that I
could not bee carryed in any under three hundred Crownes, which was more then
my purse was able to afford. With this I thought to addresse my self to some Master
of a Merchants ship, though I knew I could not bee so safe and secure in any of them,
as in a Galeon well manned and fortified with Souldiers, and Guns of Brasse; yet
I hoped in God, who is a strong refuge to them that feare him, and in this occasion
provided for mee, a cheap and sure passage. For meeting one day with my friend the
Treasurer, hee againe pitying me as a stranger and lately robbed, commended me to
the Master of a Merchant Ship, called St. <i>Sebastian</i>, whom hee knew was desirous to
carry a Chaplaine with him at his own Table. I no sooner addressed my selfe unto
him, using the name and favour of his and my friend the Treasurer, but presently I
found him willing to accept of my company, promising to carry me for nothing, and
to board mee at his own Table, onely for my prayers to God for him and his; offering
farther to give mee some satisfaction for whatsoever Sermons I should preach in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
his Ship. I blessed God, acknowledging in this also his Providence, who in all occasions
furthered my returne to <i>England</i>. The Ships being laden wee set forth towards
<i>Carthagena</i>, and the second day of our sayling wee discovered foure Ships which
made the Merchant Ships afraid, and to keepe close to the Galeons, trusting to their
strength more then their own. The Ship I was in, was swift and nimble under sail,
and kept still under the wings either of the Admirall or of some other of the best
Galeons; but all the other Merchants Ships were not so, but some slowly came on
behind, whereof two were carryed away by the <i>Hollanders</i> in the night, before ever wee
could get to <i>Carthagena</i>.</p>

<p>The greatest feare that I perceived possessed the <i>Spaniards</i> in this Voyage, was about
the Island of <i>Providence</i>, called by them <i>Sta Catalina</i>, or St. <i>Catharine</i>, from whence
they feared lest some <i>English</i> Ships should come out against them with great strength.
They cursed the <i>English</i> in it, and called the Island, the den of theeves and Pirates,
wishing that their King of <i>Spain</i> would take some course with it; or else, that it would
prove very prejudiciall to the <i>Spaniards</i>, lying neer the mouth of the <i>Desaguadero</i>, and
so endangering the Frigats of <i>Granada</i>, and standing between <i>Portobel</i> and <i>Carthagena</i>,
and so threatning the Galeons, and their Kings yeerely and mighty treasure.</p>

<p>Thus with bitter invectives against the <i>English</i> and the Island of <i>Providence</i> we sayled
on to <i>Carthagena</i>, where againe wee met with the foure Ships, which before had followed
us and had taken away two of our Ships, and now at our entering into that
Port, threatned to carry away more of our company; which they might have done,
if they would have ventured to have come upon the Ship wherein I went, which at
the turning about the land point to get into the Haven, ran upon the shore, which if
it had been rocky, as it was sandy and gravelly, had certainly there beene cast away by
keeping too neere unto the land, from which danger by the care of the Mariners, and
their active paines we were safely delivered, as also from the ships which followed us as
far as they durst for fear of the Cannon shot of the Castle; and thus we entered into the
Haven of <i>Carthagena</i>, and stayed there for the space of eight or ten dayes; where I
met with some of my Country men their Prisoners, who had been taken at Sea by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and belonged unto the Island of <i>Providence</i>; among whom was the Renowned
Captaine <i>Rouse</i>, and about a dozen more, with whom I was glad to meet,
but durst not shew them too much countenance, for feare of being suspected; yet I
soon got the good will of some of them, who, being destined to <i>Spain</i>, were very desirous
to goe in the ship, wherein I went; which desire of theirs I furthered, and was suiter
unto my Captaine to carry foure of them in his ship, which for my sake he willingly
yeelded unto; amongst these was one <i>Edward Layfield</i>, (who afterwards setting out
of St. <i>Lucar</i> for <i>England</i>, was taken Captive by the <i>Turkes</i>, and since from <i>Turkey</i>
writ into <i>England</i> unto mee to helpe to release him) with whom both at <i>Carthagena</i>,
and in the way in the ship I had great discourse concerning points of Religion,
and by him came to know some things professed in <i>England</i>, which my conscience
(whilst I lived in <i>America</i>) much inclined unto. I was much taken with his company,
and found him very officious unto mee, whose kindnesse I requited by speaking for
him in the ship to the Masters and Mariners, who otherwise were ready and forward
to abuse him and the rest of the <i>English</i> company as prisoners and slaves.</p>

<p>At <i>Carthagena</i> wee heard a report of threescore saile of ships of <i>Hollanders</i> waiting
for the Galeons, which struck no little feare into the <i>Spaniards</i>; who called a councell
whether our Fleet should winter there, or goe on to <i>Spain</i>. It proved to be but a false
report of the Inhabitants of <i>Carthagena</i>, who for their own ends and lucre would
willingly have had the ships and Galeons to have stayed there; but <i>Don Carlos de Ybarra</i>
replyed, that hee feared not a hundred saile of <i>Hollanders</i>, and therefore would goe
on to <i>Spain</i>, hoping to carry thither safely the Kings treasure. Which hee performed
and in eight dayes arrived at <i>Havana</i>, where we stayed eight dayes longer, expecting
the Fleet from <i>Vera Cruz</i>. In which time I viewed wel that strong Castle manned with
the twelve Guns, called the twelve Apostles, which would doe little hurt to an Army
by land, or marching from the River of <i>Matansos</i>. I visited here the mother of that
Mulatto, who had taken away all my meanes at Sea; and spent much time in comforting
my poore Country men the prisoners; but especially that gallant Captaine
<i>Rouse</i>, who came unto mee to complaine of some affronts which had been offered unto
him by <i>Spaniards</i>, in the ship wherein he came; which hee not being able to put up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
though a Prisoner unto them desired to question in the field, challenging his proud
contemners to meet him if they durst in any place of the Havana, (a brave courage
in a dejected and Imprisoned <i>English</i> man to challenge a <i>Spaniard</i> in his Country, a
Cock upon his own dunghill,) which as soone as I understood by <i>Edward Layfield</i>,
I desired to take up, fearing that many would fall upon him cowardly and mince him
small in peices. I sent for him to the Cloister where I lay, and there had conference
with him, prevailing so far as that I made him desist from his thoughts of going into
the field, and shewing his manhood in such a time and place, where his low condition
of a Prisoner might well excuse him. The rest of my poore country men were here much
discouraged and in some want; whom I relieved (especially <i>Layfield</i>) and incouraged as
much as I was able. I chanced here to have occasion to take a little physick before I went
again to Sea, &amp; thereby I learned what before I never knew, to wit, the dyet which on
such a day the best Physitians of <i>Havana</i> prescribe unto their patients. Whereas after the
working of my physick, I expected some peece of Mutton, or a fowl, or some other
nourishing meat, my Physitian left order that I should have a peece of rosted Porke,
which seeming unto mee a Dyet contrary to that daies extremity, I began to refuse it,
alleadging to my Doctor the contrary course of all Nations, the naturall quality of that
meat to open the body. To which he replyed, that what Porke might worke upon
mans body in other Nations, it worked not there, but the contrary; and so he wished
me to feed upon what hee had prescribed, assuring mee that it would doe mee no
hurt. Now as Hogs flesh there is held to be so nourishing, so likewise no other
meat is more then it, and Tortoises, wherewith all the ships make their provision for
<i>Spain</i>. The Tortoises they cut out in long thin slices, as I have noted before of the
Tassajos, and dry it in the wind after they have well salted it, and so it serveth the Mariners,
in all their voyage to <i>Spain</i>, which they eate boyled with a little garlicke, and
I have heard them say that to them it tasted as well as any Veale. They also take
into their ships some fowles for the Masters and Captaines tables, and live hogs,
which would seem to be enough to breed some infection in the ship, had they not
care to wash often the place where such unclean beasts lie. In the ship where I was
passenger, was killed every weeke one for the Masters, Pilots and passengers table.
Thus all things being made ready for the ships provision to <i>Spain</i>, and the Merchants
goods and the Kings Revenue being shipped in nine dayes that we abode there; we
now wanted nothing, but onely the company of the Fleet from <i>Vera Cruz</i>, which
should have met us there upon the eight day of <i>September</i>. But <i>Don Carlos de Ybarra</i>, seeing
it stayed longer then the time appointed, and fearing the weather, &amp; the New Moon
of that moneth which commonly proveth dangerous in the Golf of <i>Bahama</i>, resolved to
stay no longer, but to set out to <i>Spain</i>. On a Sabbath day therefore in the morning
we hoised sails, (being in all seven and twenty ships with those which had met with
us there from <i>Honduras</i> and the Islands), and one by one we sailed out of Havana to the
main Sea, where we that day wafted about for a good wind, and also waiting for our
guide, which was not yet come out of the Havana to guide us through the Gulfe of
<i>Bahama</i>. But that night wee wished our selves againe in the Havana, thinking that we
were compassed about with a strong Fleet of <i>Hollanders</i>; many ships came amongst us,
which made us provide for a fight in the morning. A Councell of War was called, and
all that night watch was kept, the Guns prepared, red Clothes hung round the ships,
Orders sent about both to the Galeons and to the Merchants ships what posture and
place to bee in. That which I was in, was to attend the Admirall, which I hoped
would bee a strong defence unto us; Our men were couragious and ready to fight,
though I liked not such Martiall business and discourse; but for mee a place was prepared
where I might lie hid, and be safe among some barrels of bisket; I had all the
night enough to doe, to heare the confessions of those in the Ship, who thought
they could not dye happily with the shot of a <i>Holland</i> Bullet, untill they had confessed
all their sinnes unto mee, who towards morning had more need of rest, then of
fighting, after the wearying of my eares with hearing so many wicked, grievous and
abominable sinnes. But the dawning of the day discovered our causelesse feare; which
was from friends, and not from any enemies or <i>Hollanders</i>; for the ships which were
joyned unto us in the night were as fearefull of us, as we of them, and prepared themselves
likewise to fight in the morning, which shewed unto us their colours, whereby
wee knew that they were the Fleet which wee expected from <i>Vera Cruz</i> to goe along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
with us to <i>Spain</i>. They were two and twenty Sail, which little thought to find us out
of the Havana, but within the Haven lying at Anchor, waiting for their comming,
and therefore in the night feared us much more then wee them. But when the day
cleared our doubts, feares and jealousies, then began the Martiall colours to be taken
down; the joyfull sound of Trumpets with the helpe of Neptunes Kingdomes ecchoed
from ship to ship, the boates carryed welcoming messages from one to another,
the <i>Spanish</i> Brindis with <i>buen Viaje, buen passaje</i>, was generally cried out, the whole
morning was spent in friendly acclamations and salutations from ship to ship. But in
the midst of this our joy, and Sea greetings, wee being now in all two and fifty Saile,
(yet wee not knowing well how many they were from <i>Vera Cruz</i>, nor they how many
wee were from the Havana) two ships were found amongst us, whether <i>English</i> or
<i>Hollanders</i> wee could not well discover, but the <i>English</i> Prisoners with mee told mee
they thought one was a ship of <i>England</i> called the <i>Neptune</i>, which having got the wind
of us, singled out a ship of ours, which belonged to <i>Dunkerk</i>, and from St. <i>Lucar</i> or
<i>Cales</i> had beene forced to the Kings service in that voyage to the <i>India's</i>, laden with
sugars &amp; other rich commodities to the worth of at least fourscore thousand Crowns;
and suddainly giving her a whole broad side (receiving a reply onely of two Guns) made
her yeeld, without any hope of help from so proud and mighty a Fleet, for that she was
somewhat far straggled from the rest of the ships. The whole businesse lasted not above
half an houre: but presently shee was carryed away from under our noses; the <i>Spaniards</i>
changed their merry tunes into <i>voto a dios</i> and <i>voto a Christo</i>, in raging, cursing, &amp; swearing,
some reviling at the Captaine of the ship which was taken, and saying that he was
false &amp; yeelded on purpose without fighting, because he was forced to come that Voyage;
others cursing those that tooke her, and calling them <i>bijos de puta, Borrachos, infames
Ladrones</i>, Bastards, Drunkards, infamous theeves, and Pyrates; some taking their
swords in their hands, as if they would there cut them in peeces, some laying hold of
their Muskets as if they would there shoot at them, others stamping like mad men, and
running about the ship, as if they would leap over board, and make haste after them;
others grinning their teeth at the poore <i>English</i> prisoners that were in the ship, as if
they would stab them for what (they said) their Country men had done. I must
needs say, I had enough to doe to hold some of those furious and raging brains from
doing <i>Layfield</i> some mischief, who more then the rest would bee smiling, arguing and
answering their outragious nonsense. Order was presently given to the Vice-Admirall
and two more Galeons to follow and pursue them; but all in vaine, for the wind
was against them, and so the two ships laughing and rejoycing as much as the <i>Spaniards</i>
cursed and raged, sailed away <i>con Viento en Popa</i>, with full Sail, gallantly boasting
with so rich a prize taken away from two and fifty ships, or (as I may say) from
the chiefest, and greatest strength of <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>That afternoone the Fleet of <i>Vera Cruz</i>, tooke their leave of us, (not being furnished
with Provision to goe on to <i>Spain</i> with us,) and went into the Havana; and we
set forwards towards <i>Europe</i>, fearing nothing for the present but the Gulfe of <i>Bahama</i>;
through which wee got safely with the help and guidance of such Pilots, which
our Admirall <i>Don Carlos</i> had chosen, and hired for that purpose.</p>

<p>I shall not need to tell thee my Reader of the sight which wee had of St <i>Augustine,
Florida</i>, nor of many stormes which we suffered in this Voyage, nor of the many
degrees wee came under, which made us shake with cold more then the Frost of
<i>England</i> doe in the worst of winter; onely I say, that the best of our Pilots not knowing
where they were, had like to have betrayed us all to the Rocks of <i>Bermuda</i>
one night, had not the breaking of the day given us a faire warning that we were
running upon them. For which the <i>Spaniards</i> in stead of giving God thankes for
their delivery out of that danger, began againe to curse and rage against the <i>English</i>
which inhabited that Island, saying, that they had inchanted that and the rest of those
Islands about, and did still with the devill raise stormes in those Seas when the <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet passed that way. From thence when wee had safely escaped, wee sailed well
to the Islands called <i>Terceras</i>, where faine wee would have taken in fresh water, (for
that which we had taken in at Havana now began to stink, and look yellow, making us
stop our noses, whilst wee opened our mouthes,) but rigid <i>Don Carlos</i> would not
pity the rest of his Company, who led us by the Islands; and that night following
wee all wished our selves in some harbour of them; for (though in their conceipt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
those Islands were not inchanted by <i>English</i> men, but inhabited by holy and Idolatrous
Papists) wee were no sooner got from them, when there arose the greatest
storme that wee had in all our voyage from <i>Havana</i> to <i>Spain</i>, which lasted full eight
dayes, where wee lost one Ship and indangered two Galeons, which shot off their
warning peeces for helpe, and made us all stay and wait on them, till they had repaired
their Tacklings and maine Mast. We went on sometimes one way, sometimes
another, not well knowing where wee were, drinking our stinking water by allowance
of pints, till three or foure dayes after the storme was ceased, wee discovered
land, which made all cry out, <i>Hispania, Hispania, Spain, Spain</i>; whilst a Counsell
was summoned by the Admirall to know what land that was, some sold away barrels
of bisket, others of water, to those that wanted (every one thinking that it was some
part of <i>Spain,</i>) but the result of the wise Counsell was, after they had sailed neerer
to the land, and had layed and lost many wages about it, that it was the Island of <i>Madera</i>,
which made some curse the ignorance of the Pilots, and made us all prepare our
selves with patience for a longer voyage. It pleased God from the discovery of this
Island, to grant us a favourable wind to <i>Spain</i>, where within twelve dayes we discovered
<i>Cales</i>; and some of the ships there left us, but most of them went forward
to <i>San Lucar</i>, as did the ship wherein I went; when wee came neere to the dangerous
place, which the <i>Spaniards</i> call <i>La Barra</i>, wee durst not venture our ships upon
our Pilots own knowledge; but called for Pilots to guide us in, who greedy of
their lucre came out in boats almost for every ship one. Upon the eight and twentyeth
of <i>November</i>, 1637. we cast Anchor within St. <i>Lucar de Barameda</i> about one of
the clock in the afternoon, and before evening other passengers and my selfe went a
shore (having first been searched) and although I might presently have gone to the
Cloister of St. <i>Dominick</i>, where my old friend Fryer <i>Pablo de Londres</i> was yet living,
whom I knew would bee glad of my coming from the <i>India's</i>, yet I thought fit the
first night to enjoy my friends company both <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>English</i>, (who had come
so long a voyage with me) in some Ordinary, and to take my rest better abroad then
I should doe in a Cloister, where I expected but a poore Fryers supper, a hard and
mean lodging, many foolish questions from old Fryer <i>Pablo de Londres</i> concerning
the <i>India's</i>, and my abode there so many yeeres, and finally the noise of Bells and
ratlers to rouse up the drowsie Fryers from their sleep to Matines at midnight.
That night therefore I betooke my selfe to an <i>English</i> Ordinary, where I refreshed
my selfe and my poore prisoners, (who by the Master of the ship were committed
to my charge that night and forwards upon my word, so as to bee forth comming
when they should bee called) and the next morning I sent my honest friend <i>Layfield</i>
with a letter to the Cloister to old <i>Pablo de Londres</i>, who upon my summons came
joyfully to welcome mee from the <i>India's</i>, and after very little discourse told mee
of ships in the Haven ready to set out for <i>England</i>. The old Fryer being of a decrepit
and doting age, thought every day a yeere that I stayed there, and suspended
my Voyage for <i>England</i>, and (not knowing the secrets of my heart) judged already
that the Conversion or turning of many Protestant soules to Popery waited for
my comming, which made him hasten mee, who was more desirous then hee to bee
gone the next day, if I might have found wind, weather, and shipping ready. But
God, who had been with me in almost ninety dayes sailing from <i>Havana</i> to <i>San Lucar</i>,
and had delivered mee from many a storme, prepared and furthered all things
in a very short time for the last accomplishment of my hope and desire, to returne to
<i>England</i> my native soil, from whence I had been absent almost for the space of foure and
twenty yeers.</p>

<p>My first thought here in St. <i>Lucar</i>, was to cast off now my Fryers weed, that outward
sheepskin, which covers many a wolvish, greedy, and covetous heart under it;
which doubtlesse is the ground, why in <i>Germany</i> in the Protestant and <i>Lutheran</i> towns,
when the boyes and young men see a Fryer goe along their streets, they cry out to the
neighbours, saying, a Wolfe, a Wolfe, shut your doores; meaning, that though what
they weare seeme to bee <i>pellis ovina</i>, or <i>Agnina</i>, a sheep or Lambeskin and their condition
of mortified, humble, and meek men, yet under it lyeth <i>cor Lupinum</i>, a
Wolves heart, greedy of some prey, either worldly, of wealth and riches, or spirituall,
of seducing, deceiving and misleading poore soules. Such was the habit, which
now I desired to shake off, which was a white Coat or gown hanging to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
girded about with a leathern belt, and over it from the shoulders downward a white
Scapulary (so called there,) hanging shorter then the gown both before and behind, and
over that a white hood to cover the head, and lastly, over that a black cloak with another
black hood; both which together, the black and white make the Fryers of that
profession look just like Mag-pies, and is acknowledged by the Church of <i>Rome</i> it self
in a verse which they faine of Mr. <i>Martin Luther</i>, (with what just ground I know not)
saying of his former life and profession before his Conversion, <i>Bis Corvus, bis Pica
fui, ter fune ligatus</i>. I was twice a Crow, twice a Magpie, and thrice was bound
or tyed with a Cord; by a Crow meaning an Augustin Fryer, who is all in black;
by a Magpie, meaning a Dominican, and by bound with a rope or cord, meaning a
Franciscan, who indeed is girded about with a cord made of hempe. Though the
Dominican Magpie by this his habit make such a glosse and understanding, which
is contrary to his life and conversation; for by his outward black habit, hee saith,
is signified an outward shew of deadnesse and Mortification to the world, and by
his inward white habit, an inward purity and chastity of heart, thoughts and life;
both which truely are little seen in those Fryers especially, who outwardly are worldly,
and living to the world, covetous and ambitious of honours, preferments, Bishoprickes,
and places of publique reading and preaching; and therefore have by favour
obtained many places of authority, as by the laws of <i>Aragon</i> to be the King of <i>Spain</i>
his Ghostly father, to bee Masters of the Popes Palace, and there to read a lesson
of Divinity, to be chief heads of the Inquisition, and from these places to bee promoted
to sit in the Councell of the State in <i>Spain</i>, or to bee Cardinals in <i>Rome</i>, and
so Popes, or to injoy the richest and fattest Bishopricks and Arch-Bishopricks in
<i>Spain, Italy</i>, and <i>India's</i>, which sheweth how little they are dead to the world, nay
how they are living to the world and its preferments, contrary to the black and dead
colour of their habits. So likewise doe they not live according to the whitenesse of
their inward habits, whose lives are found impure and unchast, as I could exemplify
at large, shewing what base and unclean acts have been committed by some of that
profession in the Low Countries, in <i>Spain</i>, in the <i>India's</i>, in <i>Italy</i>, nay here in <i>England</i>
by one <i>Dade</i> the Superior of them, by one <i>Popham</i> well knowen to bee a good
fellow, and still at this day abiding in the <i>Spanish</i> house, by one <i>Crafts</i> and others,
which would bee too too long a digression from the whitenesse of their habit. But
I applying the Allegory of this black and white habit otherwise unto my selfe, and
in the outward black part of it seeing the foulenesse and filthinesse of my life and Idolatrous
Preisthood in the exercise of that profession, and Orders which from <i>Rome</i> I
had received; and in the white inward habit considering yet the purity, and integrity
of those intentions and thoughts of my inward heart, in pursuance whereof
I had left what formerly I have noted, yea all <i>America</i>, which, had I continued in
it, might have been to mee a Mine of wealth, riches and treasure; I resolved here
therefore to cast off that hypocriticall cloak and habit, and to put on such Apparell
whereby I might no more appeare a Wolfe in sheepskin, but might goe boldly to my
Country of <i>England</i>, there to shew and make known the Candor of my heart, the purity
and sincerity of my thoughts, which had brought mee so farre, by a publik profession
of the pure truths of the Gospell, without any invention or addition of man
unto it. With the small meanes therefore which was left mee after so long and almost
a whole yeeres journey from <i>Petapa</i> to St. <i>Lucar</i> (having yet about a hundred
Crownes) I gave order for a sute of Cloathes to bee made by an <i>English</i> Taylor,
which I willingly put on, and so prepared my self for <i>England</i>. Three or four ships
were in readinesse, who had onely waited for the Fleet, to take in some Commodities,
especially some wedges of silver, of which I was with old <i>Pablo de Londres</i>,
in doubt which to choose. The first that went out was thought should have beene
my lot, in the which my friend <i>Layfield</i> imbarked him selfe (for all the <i>English</i> prisoners
were there freed to goe home to their Country) and from which the great providence
of God diverted mee, or else I had beene this day with <i>Layfield</i> a slave in
<i>Turkey</i>; for the next day after this ship set out, it was taken by the <i>Turkes</i>, and carryed
away for a rich prize, and all the <i>English</i> in it for Prisoners to <i>Argell</i>. But God
(who I hope had reserved mee for better things,) appointed for mee a safer convoy
home in a ship (as I was informed) belonging to Sir <i>William Curtin</i>, under the command
of an honest <i>Flemming</i>, named <i>Adrian Adrianzen</i> living at <i>Dover</i> then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
whom I agreed for my passage and dyet at his Table. This ship set out of the Barre
of St. <i>Lucar</i> the ninth day after my arrivall thither, where it waited for the company
of foure ships more, but especially for some <i>Indian</i> wedges of silver, which upon
forfeiture of them it durst not take in within the Barre and Haven.</p>

<p>And thus being now cloathed after a new fashion and ready to lead a new life; being
now changed from an <i>American</i> into the fashion of an <i>English</i> man, the tenth day after
my abode in <i>San Lucar</i>, I bad adieu to <i>Spain</i> and all <i>Spanish</i> fashions, factions,
and carriages, I bad farewell my old Fryer <i>Pablo de Londres</i>, with the rest of my acquaintance,
and so in a boat went over the bar to the ship, which that night in company
of foure more set forward for <i>England</i>. I might observe here many things of the
goodnesse of <i>Adrian Adrianzen</i>, and his good carriage towards mee in his ship, which
I will omit, having much more to observe of the goodnesse of God, who favoured this
our voyage with such a prosperous wind, and without any storm at all, that in thirteen
dayes wee came to <i>Dover</i>, where I landed, the ship going on to the <i>Downes</i>. Others
that landed at <i>Margaret</i> were brought to <i>Dover</i>, and there questioned and searched;
but I, not speaking <i>English</i>, but <i>Spanish</i>, was not at all suspected, neither judged to be an
<i>English</i> man; and so after two dayes I tooke post in company of some <i>Spaniards</i> and
an <i>Irish</i> Colonel, for <i>Canterbury</i>, and so forward to <i>Gravesend</i>. When I came to
<i>London</i>, I was much troubled within my selfe for want of my Mother tongue, (for I
could onely speak some few broken words) which made mee fearefull I should not
bee accknowledged to bee an <i>English</i> man born. Yet I thought my kinred (who
knew I had beene many yeers lost) would some way or other acknowledge mee, and
take notice of mee, if at the first I addressed my selfe unto some of them, untill
I could better expresse my selfe in <i>English</i>. The first therefore of my name, whom I
had notice of, was my Lady <i>Penelope Gage</i>, widow of Sir <i>John Gage</i>, then living in
St. <i>Jones</i>; to whom the next morning after my arrivall to <i>London</i>, I addressed my
selfe for the better discovery of some of my kinred; whom though I knew to bee Papists, and
therefore ought not to be acquainted with my inward purpose and resolution;
yet for feare of some want in the mean time, and that I might by their means practice
my selfe in the use of my forgotten native tongue, and that I might enquire what
Childs part had beene left me by my father, that I might learn some fashions, and
lastly, that in the meane time, I might search into the Religion of <i>England</i>, and
find how farre my conscience could agree with it, and bee satisfied in those scruples
which had troubled mee in <i>America</i>, for all these reasons I thought it not amisse to
looke and inquire after them. When therefore I came unto my Lady <i>Gage</i>, shee beleeved
mee to bee her kinsman, but laughed at mee, telling mee, that I spake like an
<i>Indian</i> or <i>Welch</i> man, and not like an <i>English</i> man; yet shee welcomed mee home,
and sent mee with a servant to a Brothers lodging in <i>Long Aker</i>, who being in
the Country of <i>Surrey</i>, and hearing of mee sent horse and man for mee to come to
keepe Christmas with an Uncle of mine living at <i>Gatton</i>; by whom as a lost and forgotten
Nephew, and now after foure and twenty yeeres returned home againe, I was
very kindly entertained, and from thence sent for to <i>Cheam</i>, to one Mr. <i>Fromand</i> another
kinsman, with whom I continued till after twelfth day, and so returned againe
to <i>London</i> to my brother.</p>

<p>Thus my good Reader, thou seest an <i>American</i>, through many dangers by Sea and
Land, now safely arrived in <i>England</i>; and thou maiest well with mee observe the great
and infinite goodnesse and mercy of God towards mee a wicked and wretched sinner.
How I have answered to this Gods gracious calling mee from so farre and remote a
Country, to doe him service here, I will shew thee in the Chapter following, and
conclude this my long and tedious History.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAP_XXII" id="CHAP_XXII">CHAP. XXII.</a></h3>

<h4><i>Shewing how, and for what causes, after I had arrived in</i> England, <i>I tooke
yet another Journey to</i> Rome, <i>and other parts of</i> Italy, <i>and returned againe
to settle my selfe in this my Country.</i></h4>


<p>Now Reader, as the stone that is falling, the neerer it cometh to its Center,
more haste it maketh; So I the neerer I am coming to the conclusion of this
my History, more haste I desire to make in this last Chapter, for the compleating
and finishing of it. With brevity therefore I will relate some of
my travels in <i>Europe</i>, in which I will yeeld to many of my Nation, but for <i>America</i>,
and my travels and experience there, I dare boldly challenge all travellers of my Country.
After my return to <i>London</i>, from <i>Surrey</i>, I began to expostulate with my younger
Brother (knowing hee had been present at my Fathers death, and had a chief hand
in the ordering and executing his last Will and Testament,) concerning what childs
part was left unto mee. To which hee made mee answer, that my father had indeed
left him, and my Brother the Colonell, and two other sons by a second wife, and
my owne sister, every one somewhat, but to mee nothing, nay that at his death he did
not so much as remember mee; which I could not but take to heart, and called to
minde the angry and threatning letter which I had received from him in <i>Spain</i>, because
I would not bee a Jesuite. Though for the present I said nothing, yet afterwards
in many occasions I told my Brother I would have the Will produced, and
would by course of law demand a childs part; but hee put me off, assuring me I should
never want amongst other my friends and kindred, with whom hee knew I should bee
well accommodated as long as I continued in <i>England</i>. After few dayes that I had
been in <i>London</i>, my kinsman at <i>Cheam</i>, desired me to come to live with him; where I
continued not long; for my Uncle at <i>Gatton</i> invited mee to his house, offering mee
there meat, drink, lodging, horse and man, with twenty pound a yeare, which hee
promised in other waies to make as good as thirty. Here I continued a twelve moneth,
refining my self in my native tongue, and (though altogether unknown to my Uncle and
kindred) searching into the Doctrine and truth of the Gospel professed in <i>England</i>; for
which cause I made many journeys to <i>London</i>, and then privately I resorted to some churches,
and especially to <i>Pauls</i> Church to see the service performed, and to heare the Word
of God Preached; but so, that I might not be seen, known or discovered by any Papist.
When in <i>Pauls</i> Church I heard the Organs, and the Musick, and the Prayers and Collects,
and saw the Ceremonies at the Altar, I remembred <i>Rome</i> againe, and perceived
little difference between the two Churches. I searched further into the Common-Prayer,
and carryed with me a Bible into the Country on purpose to compare the Prayers,
Epistles, and Gospels with a Masse Book, which there I had at command, and I found
no difference but onely English and Latin, which made mee wonder, and to acknowledge
that much remained still of <i>Rome</i> in the Church of <i>England</i>, and that I feared
my calling was not right. In these my scruples coming often to <i>London</i>, and conversing
with one <i>Dade, Popham</i>, and <i>Crafts, Connel</i> and <i>Brown, English</i> and <i>Irish</i> Dominican
Fryers, I found their wayes and conversations base, lewd, light and wanton, like
the <i>Spanish</i> and <i>Indian</i> Fryers, which made me againe reflect upon the Popish Church,
upheld by such Pillars. I came yet to the acquaintance of one <i>Price</i>, Superiour to
the Benedictine Monkes, whom I found to be a meer States-man, and a great Politician,
and very familiar, private, and secret with the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury William Laud</i>;
in conversion with my Brother, (who belonged then unto one Signior <i>Con</i>, the
Popes Agent, and was in such favour at the Court, that hee was sent over by the Queen
with a rich present to a Popish Idol, named our Lady of <i>Sichem</i>, in the <i>Low Countries</i>)
I heard him sometimes say, that hee doubted not but to bee shortly Curate and Parish
Preist of <i>Coven Garden</i>, sometimes that he hoped to bee made Bishop in <i>England</i>, and
that then I should want for nothing, and should live with him, till hee got mee another
Bishoprick; by which discourse of his, and by his and other Preists favour at Court
and with the Archbishop I perceived things went not well, <i>Spanish</i> Popery was much
rooted, Protestant Religion much corrupted, and the time not seasonable for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
discover my secret intents and purpose or heart. At this time comming once from
<i>Surrey</i> to <i>London</i>, I chanced to bee discovered and knowne to one of the State
Officers, a Pursevant, who had a large Commission for the apprehending of Seminary
Preists and Jesuites, named <i>John Gray</i>, who meeting mee one day in <i>Long Aker</i>, followed
and dogged me as far as <i>Lincolns Inne</i> wall, where he clapped mee on the shoulders,
and told me, that he had a Commission against mee, to apprehend mee, and carry me
to the Councell Table or to one of His Majesties Secretaries. To whom I spoke in
<i>Spanish</i> (thinking thereby to free my selfe out of his hands for a <i>Spaniard</i>:) but this
would not doe, for he replyed hee knew mee to bee an <i>English</i> man born, and by the
name of <i>Gage</i>, and Brother to Colonel <i>Gage</i> and Mr. <i>George Gage</i>, and that before he
left mee I must speake in <i>English</i> to him, he carryed mee to a Tavern, and there searched
my Pockets for Letters and mony, which in discourse he told me was too little for him
(not being above twelve shilling) and that I must goe with him to answer before one of
His Majesties Secretaries. I told him that I would willingly goe before the Archbishop
of <i>Canterbury</i>, or before Sir <i>Francis Windebanke</i>; at which he smiled, saying: I knew well
whom to make choice of to favour and protect mee, but hee would carry mee to
none of them, but to Secretary <i>Cooke</i>. I fearing the businesse might goe hard with
me, and knowing him to be greedy of money, told him that I would give him any
thing that might content him, and so offered him twelve shillings then about mee, and
my word to meet him in any place the next day, with a better and fuller purse. Hee
accepted of my money for the present, and further offer for the day following, and appointed
the <i>Angel</i> Taverne in <i>Long Aker</i>, (knowing that I lodged thereabout) to bee
the place of our meeting, and so dismissed mee. I being free from him, went immediately
to my Brother, and told him what had happened unto mee, what money I had already
given unto him, and what I had promised the next day following. My Brother
hearing me began to chafe and vex, and to fall into furious words against <i>John
Gray</i>, calling him knave and rogue, and that he could not answer what he had done,
and that hee would have his Commission taken from him, chiding mee for that I had
given him any money, and calling me young novice and unexperienced in the affairs
of <i>England</i>. This seemed strange to me, that my Brother should not onely not fear a Pursevant,
but should threaten to take away the Commission from him, who was appointed
to search for and finde out Preists and Jesuites. Yet I told him I would according to my
word and promise meet him the next day, and satisfie him for his faire carriage towards
mee; to which my Brother would by no means yeeld, but said hee would meet him;
which hee accordingly performed, and although for my sake and promise he gave him
some money, yet he brought him before Signor <i>Con</i>, and there himselfe and the Popes
Agent with him spake most bitter words unto him, and threatned him very much if ever
again he durst meddle with mee.</p>

<p>After this my Brother carryed mee to one Sir <i>William Howard</i> a Papist Knight, living
at <i>Arundel</i> gate over <i>Clements</i> Church, who was very familiar with Sir <i>Francis Windebanke</i>,
telling him what had happened unto me, and desiring him to carry me with him
in his Coach to Sir <i>Francis</i>, and to get his protection for mee. Secretary <i>Windebanke</i>
understanding who I was, told mee I should feare no Pursevant of them all, and that if
I lived quietly in <i>England</i>, no body should trouble me, and that <i>John Gray</i> was a knave,
and wished me if ever he medled with me again to come unto him. Though for the
present this was good and commodious for me to have such favour and protection, yet
I perceived, this my Brothers power, and this conniving at Preists and Jesuites could
not bee usefull for mee, if I should publish my mind and and purpose to alter my Religion.
I was therefore much troubled in mind and conscience, which I found was
curbed with the great power of the Papists. I resolved therefore to goe againe out of
<i>England</i>, and to travell in some other Countries amongst both Papists and Protestants,
and to try what better satisfaction I could find for my conscience at <i>Rome</i> in
that Religion, or in <i>France</i> and <i>Germany</i> amongst the Protestants. I writ therefore
to the Generall of the Dominicans at <i>Rome</i>, (without whose License I could not goe
thither) that hee would bee pleased to send mee his Letters Patents, to goe to conferre
some points with him; which hee willingly granted unto mee. I wanted not
money from my Uncle (who commended unto mee some businesse to bee dispatched
for him at <i>Rome</i>) for so long a journey, other friends also helped mee; but my chief
trust was upon my Brother Colonell <i>Gage</i>, then in the <i>Low Countries</i>, whom I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
not, nor had seen him from a child. I had no other passe to take shipping at <i>Dover</i>,
but onely the letter of a Papist in <i>London</i>, (by meanes of one <i>Popham</i> a Dominican
Fryer) to Sir <i>John Manwood</i> his Lady, who was then Governour of <i>Dover</i> Castle, and
with the foresaid letter suffered mee not to bee troubled, examined or searched, but
gave order that I should freely and quietly passe over in the Packet boat to <i>Dunkerke</i>,
wherewith in foure houres with a good wind I arrived, and from thence by <i>Newport</i> and
<i>Bridges</i> went to <i>Gant</i>; not farre from whence my Brother with his Regiment lay in
field against the <i>Hollander</i>. Hee was glad to see mee, and knowing what journey I
was minded to take, furnished mee with more money, and for my Uncles businesse
recommended mee to the Marques <i>De Serralvo</i> (then at <i>Brussels</i>) and to other great men,
desiring them to give mee their letters to their friends at <i>Rome</i>; from them I got a letter
to <i>Don Francisco Barbarini</i>, the Popes Nephew, and one of the chief Cardinals then
in <i>Rome</i>, likewise to Cardinal <i>Cucua</i>, and Cardinal <i>Albornos</i> both <i>Spaniards</i>. With these
letters I thought I should have occasion of some conversation with these pillars of
the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and in discourse might pry into the hearts and wayes of them,
and see whether in them were more Policy then Religion. By reason of the Warres
between <i>France</i> and the <i>Low Countries</i>, I durst not make my journey the neerest and
shortest way through <i>France</i>; but though there were Wars also in <i>Germany</i>, I thought
that would bee my safest way, and I desired much to looke into the Protestant, and
<i>Lutheran</i> Church in that Country. Whereupon I resolved from <i>Brussels</i> to goe to
<i>Namurs</i>, and from thence by water to <i>Leidge</i>, and from thence to <i>Collen</i> in <i>Germany</i>.
From <i>Leidge</i> to <i>Collen</i> though wee were twelve in company, wee were much troubled
with Souldiers; yet God still delivered me and brought me safe to <i>Collen</i>; from whence
by the river <i>Rhine</i> I went in boat to <i>Frankefort</i> in <i>September</i> at the time of that great Fair,
where I knew I should meet company of Merchants to any part of <i>Italy</i>. In all my
travells I never made a more pleasant journey then that which I made by the river <i>Rhine</i>,
where I had occasion to see many fair and goodly Cities. In <i>Frankefort</i> there I began to
take notice of the <i>Lutheran</i> Church, and for the space of a fortnight that I stayed there,
had many thoughts of discovering my selfe there, and disclaiming Popery, thinking
that there I might be sure and safe, and lie hid and unknowne to my Brothers and kinred,
who is <i>England</i> would not suffer me to live a Protestant. Yet againe I considered
how hard it would bee for mee a stranger to subsist there, and to get any livelyhood,
for the which I must first get the native tongue, and though many points that were opposite
to the Church of <i>Rome</i>, pleased me, yet in some points of that Religion my
conscience was not satisfied. At the end of the Faire I sought out for company, and
found neere a dozen wagons which were upon setting out towards <i>Auspurg</i> with goods
of Merchants, who had also hired a Convoy of thirty souldiers to goe along with
them; which I thought would be safe company for mee; with them, and many other
passengers and travellers that went in the Wagons, and on foot, by them, I went as
far as the famous and gallant City of <i>Auspurg</i>; from whence forward there was no great
danger, neither in what part belonged to the Duke of <i>Bavaria</i>, nor in the County of
<i>Tirol</i>: from whence wee passed some foure together to <i>Trent</i>; where I was taken with
the first Ague that ever in my life I remembred I had, which continued seven months
upon mee. I thought from thence to have continued my journey by land to <i>Venice</i>,
but my Ague suffered mee to goe but to <i>Verona</i>; from whence I turned to <i>Millan</i>, and
so to <i>Genoua</i>, leaving my good company; that from <i>Genoua</i> I might goe by Sea to
<i>Ligorne</i>, and so likewise to <i>Rome</i>. After a fortnights stay in <i>Genoua</i>, I went with the
Galleys of the great Duke of <i>Florence</i> to <i>Ligorne</i>, where I found no boats ready to
<i>Rome</i>, and so in the meantime, whilst they were preparing, I went to <i>Pisa</i> and <i>Florence</i>
to see those brave Cities, and returned again to <i>Ligorne</i>, where I found many boats
ready to set out to <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>The first night and day wee had a faire winde to <i>Piombino</i>; but there it turned,
and continued contrary for almost three weekes. At last it pleased God to send us
a faire wind wherewith wee went out many Boats and Falluco's in company together,
thinking all had been friends; but when wee came neere to the Castle of <i>Montalto</i>,
most of the boats having got before us, two that went in company with the boat
wherein I was, suddainly set upon us, and shewed themselves to bee <i>French</i> Pirats, who
robbed us all, and tooke from mee all the money I had, which was not then above five
pound, leaving me some Bils of exchange which I had to take up mony at <i>Rome</i>; after we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
were robbed wee called in at <i>Civita Vecha</i>; for reliefe, where I met with a good <i>English</i>
Merchant, who freely bestowed upon mee provision both of wine and meat, as much
as would well suffice mee and a friend to <i>Rome</i>, whither wee got in a day and night.
When I came to <i>Rome</i> I delivered my Letters to the Cardinals; of whom the two
<i>Spaniards</i> I found proud and stately; but <i>Don Francisco Barbarini</i>, (who was intituled
the Protector of <i>England</i>) I found more tractable, kinde, and loving. I perceived
by his discourse that hee knew much of <i>England</i>, and desired to know more; and
propounded unto mee many questions concerning the state of this Kingdome, and
especially concerning the Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, whom he seemed to affect; and yet
sometime againe would say hee feared, hee would cause some great disturbance in our
Kingdome, and that certainly for his sake and by his means the King had dissolved
lately the Parliament (which was that which before this now sitting was so suddainly
dissolved by his Majesty) which hee feared <i>Scotland</i> and most of the people of <i>England</i>,
would take very ill. Hee asked mee further what conceipt the people had of the said
Archbishop; and whether they did not mistrust that hee complyed much with the
Court of <i>Rome</i>. And lastly, he told mee that hee thought, the creating of an <i>English</i>
Cardinal at <i>Rome</i> might be of great consequence for the conversion of the whole Kingdome.
I laid up in my heart all this discourse, and well perceived some great matters
were in agitation at <i>Rome</i>, and some secret compliance from <i>England</i> with that Court,
which I purposed to discover more at large among some friends there.</p>

<p>After this discourse with the Cardinall, I was invited to the <i>English</i> Colledge to
dinner by one Father <i>Fitzherbert</i>, who was then Rector, a great States-man and Politician,
with whom I had also great discourse concerning my Brother Colonel <i>Gage</i>,
concerning my travels in <i>America</i>, and lastly concerning <i>England</i>; whereof I perceived
little discourse could bee had in <i>Rome</i>, except the Archbishop <i>William Laud</i> had
his part and share in it. The Jesuite began highly to praise the Arch-prelate for his
moderate carriage towards Papists and Preists, boasting of the free accesse which one
<i>Simons, alias Flood</i>, a Jesuite had unto him at all houres, and in all occasions; and to extoll
him the more, he brought in the Archbishop, <i>Abbot</i> whom he cried down as much
for a cruel enemie and persecutor of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and of all Papists and Preists.
But the now Archbishop, said hee, is not onely favourable unto us there, but here
desireth to make daily demonstrations of his great affection to this our Court and
Church; which, hee shewed not long since in sending a Common Prayer Booke,
(which hee had composed for the Church of <i>Scotland</i>) to bee first viewed, and approved
of by our Pope and Cardinals. Who perusing it, liked it very well, for Protestants
to be trained in a Form of Prayer and service; yet considering the State of <i>Scotland</i>,
and the temper and tenents of that people, the Cardinals, (first giving him thanks for his
respect and dutifull compliance with them) sent him word, that they thought that form
of prayer was not fitting for <i>Scotland</i>, but would breed some stir and unquietnesse there,
for that they understood the <i>Scots</i> were aversed from all set Forms, &amp; would not be tyed
and limited to the invention of mans spirit, having (as they thought) the true and unerring
Spirit of God in them, which could better teach and direct them to pray. All this
(said Father <i>Fitzherbert</i>) I was witnesse of, who was then sent for by the Cardinals (as in
all like occasions, and affaires concerning <i>England</i>) to give them my opinion concerning
the said Common Prayer Booke, and the temper of the <i>Scots</i>. But the good Archbishop
(quoth hee) hearing the censure of the Cardinals concerning his intention and
Form of Prayer, to ingratiate himself the more into their favour, corrected some things
in it, and made it more harsh and unreasonable for that Nation; which wee already
heare they have stomacked at, and will not suffer it in many parts to be read; and wee
justly fear that this his Common Prayer Book, &amp; his great compliance with this Court,
will at last bring strife and division between the two Kingdomes of <i>Scotland</i> and <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>And this most true Relation of <i>William Laud</i> late Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, (though
I have often spoken of it in private discourse and publiquely preached it at the
Lecture of <i>Wingham</i> in <i>Kent</i>,) I could not in my conscience omit it here; both to vindicate
the just censure of death, which the now sitting Parliament have formerly given against
him for such like practises and compliance with <i>Rome</i>; and secondly to reprove the
ungrounded opinion and errour of some ignorant and Malignant spirits, who to
my knowledge have since his death highly exalted him, and cryed him up for a Martyr.
At the same time whilst I was at <i>Rome</i>, I understood of another great businesse concerning
<i>England</i>, then in agitation amongst the Cardinals, and much prosecuted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
this <i>Fitzherbert</i>, and one father <i>Courtney</i> a Jesuite, son to one Sir <i>Thomas Leeds</i>; which
was, to create one of the <i>English</i> Nation Cardinall; that so the Conversion of <i>England</i>,
what by the Assistance of <i>William Laud</i>, what by the power of a higher person,
and what by the authority of the said Cardinall, might be more fully and earnestly
plotted and indeavoured. This businesse was much agitated in <i>England</i> by Signior <i>Con</i>,
at whose house in <i>Long Aker</i> were many meetings of the chief Gentry of the Papists. In
<i>Rome</i> Sir <i>William Hamilton</i> then Agent for the Queene, vied much for the said Cardinals
Cap, and got a great number of friends to further this his ambitious design. But
hee was too yong, and some scandall of a Gentlewoman, who stuck too close to him,
made the red Cap unfit for his head; and secondly, because a greater then hee, to wit,
Sir <i>Kenelham Digby</i> was appointed by the Queen to bee her Agent there; who sent before
him his Chaplain, a great Politician and active Priest, named <i>Fitton</i>, to take up
his lodging and make way, and friends for his ambitious preferment; who in his
daily discourse cryed up his Master <i>Digby</i> for Cardinall, and told mee absolutely, that
hee doubted not but hee would carry it. But though hee had great favour from the
Queen, and was her Agent; yet hee had strong Antagonists in <i>Fitzherbert, Courtney</i>,
and the rest of the crew of the Jesuites, who looked upon that honour and red Cap as
better becomming one of their profession, and fitter for a head which had formerly
worne a four Cornered black Cap, to wit, Sir <i>Toby Mathy</i>. But in case the said Cap
should fall from Sir <i>Toby</i> his head, then they would helpe and further a third, whose
birth and Nobility should advance him before Sir <i>Kenelham Digby</i>, to wit, <i>Walter
Mountague</i>, the old Earle of <i>Manchester</i> his sonne at that time.</p>

<p>And thus it was a generall and credible report in <i>Rome</i>, that either a <i>Digby</i>, a <i>Mathy</i>,
or a <i>Mountague</i>, should that yeere bee made Cardinall. Whereby I perceived that <i>England</i>
was comming neere to <i>Rome</i>, and that my design of professing and following the
truth in <i>England</i> was blasted, and that in vain I had come from <i>America</i> for satisfaction
of my conscience in <i>England</i>. I was more troubled now then ever; and desired to
try all wayes, if I could bee better satisfied concerning the Popish Religion in <i>Rome,
Naples</i> or <i>Venice</i>, (whither I went) then I had been in <i>America</i> and among the <i>Spaniards</i>.
But I found such exorbitances and scandalls in the lives of some Cardinals of <i>Rome</i>,
whilst I was there, especially in <i>Don Antonio Barbarini</i>, and Cardinal <i>Burgess</i>, who at
midnight was taken by the <i>Corchetes</i> or Officers of Justice in uncivill wayes, and came
off from them with money, that I perceived the Religion was but as I had found it in
<i>America</i>, a wide and open doore to loosnesse and policy, and the like in <i>Naples</i> and <i>Venice</i>,
which made mee even hate what before I had professed for Religion, and resolve,
that if I could not live in <i>England</i>, and there injoy my Conscience, that I would live in
<i>France</i>, for a while, untill I had well learned that tongue, and then associate my selfe
unto the best reformed Protestant Church; Whereupon I obtained from the General
of the Dominicans this ensuing order to live in the Cloister of <i>Orleans</i>, intending from
thence at my best opportunity to goe to <i>Paris, Lyons</i>, or some other place, and shake off
my Magpy habit, and to live and dye in <i>France</i> in the true Protestant and reformed Religion
as professed there.</p>

<p>Yet after I had got this Order, I bethought my selfe further that I would try one
way, which was to see if I could find out a Miracle, which might give mee better satisfaction
of the <i>Romish</i> Religion, then had the former experience of my life, and the lives
of the Priests, Cardinals, and all such with whom I had lived in <i>Spain</i> and <i>America</i>. I
had heard much of a Picture of our Lady of <i>Loretto</i>, and read in a Booke of Miracles or
lies concerning the same, that whosoever prayed before that picture in the state of mortall
sinne, the picture would discover the sinne in the soule, by blushing, and by sweating.
Now I framed this argument to my selfe, that it was a great sin, the sin of unbeliefe,
or to waver and stagger in points of Faith; but in mee (according to the Tenents
of <i>Rome</i>) was this sin, for I could not believe the point of Transubstantiation, and many
other; therefore (if the Miracles which were printed of the foresaid Lady of <i>Loretto</i>
were true, and not lies) certainly shee would blush and sweat, when such an unbeliever
as I prayed before her. To make this triall, I went purposely to <i>Loretto</i>, and kneeling
downe before God, not with any faith I had in the picture; I prayed earnestly to the
true Searcher of all hearts, that in his Son Jesus Christ he would mercifully looke upon
me a wretched sinner, and inspire and enlighten mee with his Spirit of truth, for the
good and salvation of my soule; In my prayer I had a fixed and setled eye upon the
Ladies picture, but could not perceive that shee did either sweat or blush, wherewith
I arose up from my knees much comforted and incouraged in my resolution to renounce
and abandon Popery, and saying within my selfe as I went out of the Church,
surely if my Lady neither sweat nor blush, all is well with mee, and I am in a good
way for salvation, and the miracles written of her are but lies. With this I resolved to
follow the truth in some Protestant Church in <i>France</i>, and to relinquish errour and
superstition. Upon which good purpose of mine, I presently perceived the God of
truth did smile, with what I heard hee was ordering in <i>England</i> by an Army of <i>Scotland</i>
raised for Reformation, and by a new Parliament called to <i>Westminster</i>, at which I saw
the Papists and Jesuites there began to tremble, and to say that it would blast all their
designes, and all their hopes of setling Popery; <i>William Laud</i> his policy was now condemned
and cursed, <i>Con</i> was dead at <i>Rome</i>, the Cardinals Cap for one of the three fore-named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
named was no more spoken of, <i>Fitton</i> was daunted, <i>Fitzherbert</i> and <i>Courtney</i> quite disheartned,
Sir <i>Kenelham Digby</i> his Agency and comming to Rome put off and suspended,
and with all this good newes I was much heartned and incouraged to leave off my journey
to <i>France</i>, and to return to <i>England</i>, where I feared not my Brother nor any kindred,
nor the power of the Papists, but began to trust in the protection of the Parliament,
which I was informed would reform Religion, and make such laws as should tend to the
undermining of all the Jesuits plots, and to the confusion and subversion of the <i>Romish</i>
errours and Religion. I was too weak of body to make my journey by land (by reason
of my long Ague which had but newly left mee) and so resolved to goe to <i>Ligorne</i> to find
out shipping there; where I found foure or five ships of <i>English</i> and <i>Hollanders</i> ready to
set out, but were bound to touch at <i>Lisboe</i> in their way. I bargained with one Captaine
<i>Scot</i> for my passage, first to <i>Lisboe</i>, intending there to make a second bargain. We
had no sooner sailed on as farre as to the Coast of <i>France</i>, joyning to the <i>Dutchy</i> of
Savoy, but presently from <i>Canes</i> came out part of a Fleet lying there under the command
of the Bishop of <i>Burdeaux</i> to discover us, and take us for a lawfull prize. I
might say much here of the valour of the good old Captaine <i>Scot</i>, who seeing all the
other ships had yeelded to the <i>French</i> men of Warre, would upon no termes yeeld to be
their prize, (which they challenged because wee were bound for <i>Lisboe</i>, then their enemies
Country) but would fight with them all, and at last rather blow up his ship, then
to deliver the goods which had been intrusted to him by the Merchants of <i>Ligorne</i>. We
were in a posture to fight, our guns ready, and Mariners willing to dye that day, which
was heavy news to me. After much treaty between the <i>French</i> and our valorous Captain,
who still held out and would not yeeld, there came up to us two ships to give us
the last warning that if wee yeelded not, they would immediately set our ship on fire.
With this all the passengers and many more in the ship desired the Captaine to yeeld
upon some faire Articles for the securing of what goods he had for <i>England</i>, and should
appeare were not any way for the strengthening of any enemies to the State and Kingdome
of <i>France</i>. With much adoe our Captaine was perswaded, and we were carried
with the rest into <i>Canes</i> for a lawfull prize. I seeing that the ships were like to bee
stayed there long, obtained the Bishop of <i>Bordeaux</i> his passe to goe to <i>Marcells</i>, and
from thence by land through <i>France</i>. Which being granted, I went by water to <i>Tolon</i>,
and from thence to <i>Marcells</i>, and so in company of Carriers to <i>Lions</i>, and from thence
to <i>Paris, Roane</i>, and <i>Deepe</i>, where in the first packet boat to <i>Rye</i> I passed over to <i>England</i>,
where I landed upon <i>Michaelmas</i> day the same yeere that this present Parliament
began to sit the <i>November</i> following. My Brothers Spirit I found was not much daunted
with the new Parliament, nor some of the proudest Papists, who hoped for a suddain
dissolving of it; But when I saw their hopes frustrated by His Majesties consent
to the continuing of it, I thought the acceptable time was come for mee, wherein I
ought not to dissemble any further with God, the world and my friends, and so resolved
to bid adieu to flesh and blood; and to prize Christ above all my kindred, to own and
professe him publiquely maugre all opposition of hell and kindred to the contrary. I
made my self first knowne to Doctor <i>Brunnick</i> Bishop of <i>Exeter</i>, and to Mr. <i>Shute</i> of
<i>Lumbard street</i>, from whom I had very comfortable and strong incouragements. The Bishop
of <i>Exeter</i> carried me to the Bishop of <i>London</i> then at <i>Fullom</i>, from whom I received
order to Preach my Recantation Sermon at <i>Pauls</i>: which done, I thought I must yet
doe more to satisfie the world of my sincerity, knowing that Converts are hardly believed
by the common sort of people, unlesse they see in them such actions which may
further disclaime <i>Rome</i> for ever for the future. Whereupon I resolved to enter into
the state of Marriage (to which God hath already given his blessing) which the Church
of <i>Rome</i> disavowes to all her Preists. What I have beene able to discover for the good
of this State I have done, and not spared (when called upon) to give in true evidence
upon my Oath against Jesuites, Preists, and Fryers; for the which (after a faire invitation
from my Brother Colonel <i>Gage</i>, to come over again to <i>Flanders</i>, offering mee a
thousand pound ready money) I have been once assaulted in <i>Aldersgate street</i>; and another
time like to be killed in <i>Shooe lane</i> by a Captain of my Brothers Regiment, named
<i>Vincent Burton</i>, who (as I was after informed) came from <i>Flanders</i> on purpose to make me
away or convey mee over, and with such a malicious designe followed mee to my
lodging, lifting up the latch and opening the doore, (as hee had seene mee done) and
attempting to goe up the staires to my chamber without any inquiry for mee, or knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
at the doore; from whom God graciously delivered me by the weak meanes of a
woman my Land-lady, who stopped him from going any further; and being demanded
his name, and answering by the name of <i>Steward</i>, and my Land-lady telling him from
mee that I knew him not, he went away chafing and saying that I should know him,
before he had done with mee. But hee that knoweth God well, shall know no enemy
to his hurt; neither have I ever since seene or knowen this man. I might here also
write down the contents of a threatning letter from mine own Brother, when hee was
Colonell for the King of <i>England</i> and Governour of <i>Oxford</i>, which I forbear with some
tender consideration of flesh and blood. At the beginning of the warres I confesse I
was at a stand as a Neophyt and new plant of the Church of <i>England</i> concerning the
lawfulnesse of the warre; and so continued above a yeere in <i>London</i> spending my owne
meanes, till at last I was fully satisfied, and much troubled to see that the Papists and most
of my kindred were entertained at <i>Oxford</i>, and in other places of the Kings Dominions;
whereupon I resolved upon a choice for the Parliament cause, which now in their lowest
estate and condition I am not ashamed to acknowledge. From their hands and by their
order I received a Benefice, in the which I have continued almost foure yeers preaching
constantly for a through and godly Reformation intended by them, which I am ready
to witnesse with the best drops of blood in my veins, though true it is I have been envied,
jealousied and suspected by many; to whom I desire this my History may be a better
witnesse of my sincerity, and that by it I may perform what our Saviour Christ spoke
to <i>Peter</i>, saying, And thou being converted strengthen thy Brethren. I shall think my
time and pen happily imployed if by what here I have written, I may strengthen the
perusers of this small volume against Popish superstition whether in <i>England</i>, other parts
of <i>Europe, Asia</i>, or <i>America</i>; for the which I shall offer up my dayly prayers unto him,
who (as I may well say) miraculously brought me from <i>America</i> to <i>England</i>, and hath
made use of mee as a <i>Joseph</i> to discover the treasures of <i>Egypt</i>, or as the spies to search into
the land of <i>Canaan</i>, even the God of all Nations, to whom be ascribed by mee and all
true and faithfull Beleevers, Glory, Power, Majesty and mercy for evermore. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h2><a name="Some_brief_and_short_Rules_for_the_better_learning" id="Some_brief_and_short_Rules_for_the_better_learning">Some brief and short Rules for the better learning
of the <i>Indian</i> tongue called <i>Poconchi</i>, or <i>Pocoman</i>,
commonly used about <i>Guatemala</i> and
some other parts of <i>Honduras</i>.</a></h2>


<p>Although it bee true that by the daily conversation which in
most places the <i>Indians</i> have with the <i>Spaniards</i>, they for
the most part understand the <i>Spanish</i> tongue in common
and ordinary words, so that a <i>Spaniard</i> may travell amongst
them, and bee understood in what hee calleth for
by some or other of the Officers, who are appointed to attend
upon all such as travell and passe through their townes: Yet because
the perfect knowledge of the <i>Spanish</i> tongue is not so common to all <i>Indians</i>,
both men and women, nor so generally spoken by them as their owne;
therefore the Preists and Fryers have taken paines to learn the native tongues
of severall places and countries, and have studied to bring them to a Form
and method of Rules, that so the use of them may bee continued to such as
shall succeed after them. Neither is there any one language generall to all
places, but so many severall and different one from another, that from <i>Chiapa</i>,
and <i>Zoques</i>, to <i>Guatemala</i>, and <i>San Salvador</i>, and all about <i>Honduras</i>, there
are at least eighteen severall languages, and in this district some Fryers who
have perfectly learned six or seven of them. Neither in any place are the <i>Indians</i>
taught or preached unto but in their native and mother tongue, which
because the Preist onely can speake, therefore are they so much loved and respected
by the Natives. And although for the time I lived there, I learned
and could speake in two severall tongues, the one called <i>Cacchiquel</i>, the other
<i>Poconchi</i>, or <i>Pocoman</i>, which have some connexion one with another; yet the <i>Poconchi</i>
being the easiest, and most elegant, and that wherein I did constantly
preach and teach, I thought fit to set down some rules of it, (with the Lords
Prayer, and brief declaration of every word in it) to witnesse and testifie to
posterity the truth of my being in those parts, and the manner how those barbarous
tongues have, are, and may be learned.</p>

<p>There is not in the <i>Poconchi</i> tongue, nor in any other the diversity of declensions,
which is in the <i>Latin</i> tongue; yet there is a double way of declining
all Nownes, and conjugating all Verbes, and that is with divers particles
according to the words beginning with a vowell or a consonant; neither is there
any difference of cases, but onely such as the said Particles or some Prepositions
may distinguish.</p>

<p>The Particles for the words or Nownes beginning with a Consonant are as
followeth,</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Nu, A, Ru,</i> plural. <i>Ca. Ata. Qui tacque.</i> As for example, <i>Bat</i>, signifieth a
house, and <i>Tat</i>, signifieth father, which are thus declined;</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Nupat</i>, my house, <i>Apat</i>, thy house, <i>Rupat</i>, his house. Plural. <i>Capat</i>, our
house, <i>Apatta</i>, your house, <i>Quipat tacque</i>, their house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Sing. <i>Nutat</i>, my Father, <i>Atat</i>, thy Father, <i>Rutat</i> his Father. Plural. <i>Catat</i>, our Father,
<i>Atatta</i>, your Father, <i>Quitat tacque</i>, their Father. Thus are declined
Nownes beginning with a Consonant. As, <i>Queh</i>, a horse, <i>Nuqueh, Aqueh,
Ruqueh, &amp;c. Huh</i>, booke, or paper, <i>Nuhuh, Ahuh, Ruhuh. Moloh</i>, Egge,
<i>Numoloh, Amoloh, Rumoloh. Holom</i>, Head, <i>Nuholom, Aholom, Ruholom. Chi</i>,
Mouth, <i>Nuchi, Achi, Ruchi. Cam</i>, hand, <i>Nucam, Acam, Rucam. Chac</i>, flesh,
<i>Nuchac, Achac, Ruchac. Car</i>, fish, <i>Nucar, Acar, Rucar. Cacar, Acarta, Qui cartacque.
Chacquil</i>, body or flesh of man; <i>Nuchacquil, Achacquil, Ruchacquil,
Cachacquil, Achacquilta, Quichacquil tacque</i>.</p>

<p>Some words there are which are pronounced like <i>ts</i>, which are written not
with <i>ts</i>, but with this letter <i>t&#541;</i>, peculiar in that tongue; as for <i>tsi</i>, dogge, <i>tsiquin</i>,
bird, <i>Nutsi</i>, my dog, <i>Atsi</i>, thy dog, <i>Rutsi</i>, his dog, <i>Catsi</i>, our dog, <i>Atsita</i>,
your dog, <i>Quitsi tacque</i>, their dog. <i>Nutsiquin</i>, my bird, <i>Atsiquin</i>, thy bird,
<i>Rutsiquin</i>, his bird, <i>Catsiquin</i>, our bird, <i>Atsiquinta</i>, your bird, <i>Quitsi quintacque</i>,
their bird.</p>

<p>There are no severall terminations for cases, as in Latin; but the cases are
distinguished with some particles or prepositions, as for example. The house
of <i>Peter, Rupat Pedro</i>, putting the possessours name, and the particle, <i>Ru</i>, which
is a possessive. So for the dative, add the particle <i>Re</i>; as for example, give to
<i>Peter</i> his dog, <i>Chaye re Pedro rutsi</i>. For the accusative, when it is motion to a
place, or else not, adde <i>Chi</i>, as for example, I goe to the house of <i>Peter, Quino
chi rupat Pedro</i>. The Vocative admitteth of this particle <i>ah</i>, or <i>ha</i>, of wishing
or calling, as, O my son, or ho my son, <i>Ah vacun</i>, or <i>ha vacun</i>. The Ablative
keeping stil the same termination with the Nominative, is expressed with
some preposition or other, as in my mouth, <i>pan nuchi</i>, with my hand, <i>chi nucam</i>.
In signifying I, is undeclinable, as also, <i>At</i>, signifying you, or thou.
The possessive mine, is also undeclinable, as <i>vi chin</i>, mine, or for me; so thine,
or for thee, <i>Ave</i>. Where note that in this tongue there is no <i>w</i>, but <i>v</i>, or <i>u</i>,
are pronounced as <i>w</i>, as though wee pronounce, <i>wacun</i>, my sonne, <i>wichin</i>,
mine or for mee, <i>Awe</i>, thine or for thee wee write <i>vacun, vichin, Ave</i>.</p>

<p>The Particles or letters, which serve for Nounes beginning with a Vowell,
are as followeth. Singular. <i>V. Av. R.</i> Plural. <i>C.</i> or <i>Qu. Avta. C.</i> or <i>qu. tacque</i>,
as for example, <i>Acun</i>, signifieth son, <i>Ixim</i>, Corn, <i>Ochoch</i>, likewise house,
which are thus declined.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Vacun</i>, my son, <i>Avacun</i>, thy son, <i>Racun</i>, his son. Plural. <i>Cacun</i>, our son, <i>Avacunta</i>,
your son, <i>Cacuntaque</i>, their son.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Vixim</i>, my corn, <i>Avixim</i>, thy corn, <i>Rixim</i>, his corn. Plural. <i>Quixim</i>, our
corn, <i>Aviximta</i>, your corn, <i>Quixim tacque</i>, their corn.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Vochoch</i>, my house, <i>Avochoch</i>, thy house, <i>Rochoch</i>, his house. Plural.
<i>Cochoch</i>, our house, <i>Avochochta</i>, your house, <i>Cochochtaque</i>, their
house.</p>

<p>So likewise are varied or declined, <i>Abix</i>, signifying a plantation, or peece of
ground sowen. <i>Acal</i>, earth or ground. <i>Vleu</i>, also earth or ground. <i>Acach</i>,
hen. Save onely that the words beginning with <i>I</i>, admit <i>qu</i>, in the first and
third person plurall; the rest admit for the same persons plurall, <i>C</i>, onely.</p>

<p>And as thus I have observed for the varying or declining of Nounes; so also
doe all the Verbes admit of severall particles for their conjugating, according
as they begin either with a vowell or a consonant.</p>

<p>Those that begin with a consonant have somewhat like the Nounes these
articles following.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Nu, Na, Inru.</i> Plural. <i>Inca, Nata, Inquitacque.</i> As for example, <i>locoh</i>,
to love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Sing. <i>Nulocoh</i>, I love, <i>Nalocoh</i>, thou lovest, <i>Inrulocoh</i>, hee loveth. Plural. <i>Incalocoh</i>,
wee love, <i>Nalocohta</i>, yee love, <i>Inquilocohtaque</i>, they love.</p>

<p><i>Nuroca</i>, or <i>Nurapa</i>, I whip, or beat. <i>Naroca</i> or <i>Narapa</i>, thou whippest, or
beatest; <i>Inruroca</i>, or <i>Inrurapa</i>, hee whippeth or beateth. Plural. <i>Incaroca</i>,
or <i>Incarapa</i>, wee whip, or beat; <i>Narocata</i>, or <i>Narapata</i>, yee whip, or beat,
<i>Inquirocatacque</i>, or <i>Inquirapatacque</i>, they whip or beat.</p>

<p><i>Nutsiba</i>, I write, <i>Natsiba</i>, thou writest, <i>Inrutsiba</i>, hee writeth. Plural. <i>Incatsiba</i>,
wee write, <i>Natsibata</i>, yee write, <i>Inquitsibatacque</i>, they write.</p>

<p>There is no preterimperfect tense, nor preterpluperfect tense; but the preterperfect
tense standeth for them; neither is there any Future, but the present tense
expresseth it, and is understood for it, according to the sense of the discourse, as
<i>Nulocoh Pedro</i>, I love or wil love <i>Peter. Tinulocoh</i>, I love thee, or I wil love thee.
Yet sometimes for fuller expression of the Future tense, is added this Verbe,
<i>inva</i>, I wil, <i>nava</i>, thou wilt, <i>Inra</i>, he will, as <i>Inva nulocoh Pedro</i>, I will love <i>Peter</i>.</p>

<p>The Particles for the Preterperfect tense, are as follow:</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Ixnu. Xa. Ixru.</i> Plural. <i>Ixca. Xata. Ixqui tacque.</i> Where note, that in all
these particles, and in all this language, the letter <i>X</i>, is pronounced like <i>sh.</i> as
<i>Ixnu</i>, like <i>Ishnu. Xa</i>, like <i>sha. Ixru</i>, like <i>Ishru. Ixca</i> like <i>Ishca</i>, and so forth.</p>

<p>Preterperf. Sing. <i>Ixnulocoh</i>, I have loved; <i>Xalocoh</i> thou hast loved, <i>Ixrulocoh</i>,
he hath loved. Plural. <i>Ixcalocoh</i>, we have loved, <i>Xalocohta</i>, yee have loved, <i>Ixquilocohtacque</i>,
they have loved. And so of all the Verbes above.</p>

<p>The Particles for the Imperative Mood are these following:</p>

<p>For the singular number, and second person, <i>Cha</i>; for the third person singular
<i>Chiru</i>; for the first person plural, <i>Chica</i>; for the second, <i>Cha ta</i>, for the third
<i>Chiqui tacque</i>: as for example. <i>Chalocoh</i>, love thou. <i>Chirulocoh</i>, let him love.
Plural. <i>Chicalocoh</i>, let us love; <i>Chalocohta</i>, love yee. <i>Chiquilocoh tacque</i>, let them
love. And so of the rest of the Verbes above.</p>

<p>The Optative Mood is the same with the Indicative; adding to it this
Particle <i>Ta</i>, which signifieth as much as <i>utinam</i>, or, would to God, as
<i>Nalocoh ta Dios</i>, would God thou love God, <i>Ixnulocoh ta Dios</i>, would God
I had loved God.</p>

<p>The Conjunctive Mood also is the same with the Indicative, adding to it this
Particle, or Preposition <i>vei</i>, and <i>ta</i>, if. As for example <i>vei nalocoh ta Dios</i>, if
thou love God, <i>vei ixnulocoh ta Dios</i>, if I had loved God.</p>

<p>There is no Infinitive Mood, but the Indicative serveth for it. As, <i>Quinchol
nutsiba</i>, I can write. <i>Quinquimi</i>, signifieth to die, <i>Nuraeh</i>, I desire, <i>Nuraeh
quinquimi</i>, I desire to dye.</p>

<p>Note further, that in all Verbes Actives, when mee and thee are expressed
as the Accusative case following the Verbe, they are coupled to the person that
doeth or goeth before the Verbe, by these two Particles for the present tense,
<i>Quin</i>, mee, <i>Ti</i>, thee. And for the preterperfect tense, <i>xin</i>, mee, <i>ixti</i>, thee. As
for example.</p>

<p><i>Quinalocoh</i>, thou lovest me. <i>Xinalocoh</i>, thou hast loved me. <i>Quinraalocoh</i>, thou
wilt love me. <i>Quinalocohta</i>, love me, or I pray God thou love me. <i>Vei quinalocoh</i>,
if thou love me; <i>vei xinalocoh</i>, if thou hast or hadst loved mee; <i>Quinaraeh
nalocoh</i>, thou desirest to love me. So for the second person being the Accusative. <i>Tinulocoh</i>,
I love thee. <i>Ixtinulocoh</i>, I have loved thee. <i>Tiranulocah</i>, I will love thee.
<i>Tinulocohta</i>, pray God I love thee; <i>vei tinulocoh</i>, if I love thee; <i>vei ixtinulocoh</i>,
if I have or had loved thee. <i>Tinuraeh nulocoh</i>, I desire to love thee.</p>

<p>Note further, that these two Verbes, <i>Quinchol</i>, which signifieth, I can or am
able, and <i>Inva</i>, which signifieth I will, when they are put with other Verbes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
whatsoever person, they are elegantly put impersonally in the third person singular.
As for example:</p>

<p><i>Inchol nulocoh</i>, I can love. <i>Inra nulocoh</i>, I will love. <i>Ixra ixnulocoh</i>, I have
been willing to love. <i>Ixchol ixnulocoh</i>, I have been able to love. <i>Tichol nulocoh</i>,
I can love thee, <i>Tira nulocoh</i>, I will love thee.</p>

<p>The Letters or Particles for Verbes beginning with a Vowell, are these that
follow.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Inv. Nav. Inr.</i> Plural. <i>Inqu.</i> or <i>Inc. Nauta. Inqu tacque</i>, or <i>Inc tacque</i>.
As for example, <i>Eça</i>, signifieth to deliver, which is thus formed.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Inveça</i>, I deliver. <i>Naveça</i>, thou deliverest, <i>Inreça</i>, he delivereth. Plural.
<i>Inqueça</i>, wee deliver, <i>Naveçata</i>, yee deliver; <i>Inqueça tacque</i>, they deliver.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is a simple signifying to wish or desire, or will a thing, which is never found
without these particles.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Inva</i>, I will, <i>Nava</i>, thou wilt, <i>Inra</i>, he will; Plural. <i>Inca</i> we will, <i>Navata</i>,
yee will, <i>Incatacque</i>, they will. <i>Ivereh</i>, to heare. <i>Invivireh</i>, I heare. <i>Navivireh</i>,
thou hearest, <i>Inrivireh</i>, he heareth. Plural. <i>Inquivireh</i>, we heare; <i>Navivirehta</i>,
yee heare; <i>Inquivireh tacque</i>, they heare.</p>

<p>Thus have I briefly set downe the way of declining all sorts of Nounes, and
conjugating all sorts of Verbes of this tongue. It remaineth now that I speak
of Verbes passives; their forming and their conjugating with like Particles.
The Verbes passives being of divers terminations, are diversly formed.
Commonly those that end with an <i>A</i>, cut off the <i>A</i>, in the passive, and to the
last consonant add <i>hi</i>. As for example, <i>Nuroca</i>, I whip or beat, the passive is
<i>Quinrochi</i>. So <i>Nurapa</i>, I whip or beat, in the passive is <i>Quinraphi</i>. Except
<i>Nutsiba</i>, I write, which changeth <i>b</i> into <i>m. Quintsimhi</i>, I am written. Those
that end in <i>oh</i>, change <i>oh</i> into <i>onhi</i>. As <i>nulocoh</i>, I love. <i>Quinloconhi</i>, I am loved.
So those that end in <i>eh</i>, doe change <i>eh</i> into <i>hi</i>, as <i>Invivireh</i>, I hear, <i>Quinivirhi</i>,
I am heard. <i>Nucuta</i>, I teach, <i>Quincuthi</i>, I am taught, by the first rule. But
those that end in <i>ça</i> (where note this letter <i>ç</i> or <i>c</i>, with a tittle under it, is pronounced
like <i>s</i>) change the <i>a</i> into <i>ihi</i>. As for example: <i>inveça</i> I deliver, <i>Quineçihi</i>,
I am delivered. <i>Nucamça</i>, I kill, <i>Quincamçihi</i>, I am killed; those that end
in <i>ach</i>, adde <i>hi</i> in the passive, as <i>Nuçach</i>, I forgive, in the passive maketh <i>Quinçachhi</i>,
I am forgiven. The particles that vary, or conjugate the Verbes passives,
are these following:</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Quin. Ti. In</i>. Plural. <i>Coh</i>, or <i>Co. Tita. Quitacque.</i> As for example:</p>

<p><i>Quinloconchi</i>, I am loved, <i>Tiloconhi</i>, thou art loved. <i>Inloconhi</i>, hee is loved.
Plural. <i>Coloconhi</i>, wee are loved. <i>Tiloconhita</i>, yee are loved. <i>Quiloconhitacque</i>,
they are loved.</p>

<p><i>Quinrochi</i>, I am beaten or whipped; <i>Tirochi</i>, thou art beaten or whipped; <i>Inrochi</i>,
he is beaten or whipped. Plural. <i>Corochi</i>, we are beaten or whipped; <i>Tirochita</i>,
ye are beaten or whipped; <i>Quirochi tacque</i>, they are beaten or whipped.</p>

<p>The Particles for the preterperfect tense are these following.</p>

<p>Sing. <i>Xin. Ixti. Ix.</i> Plural. <i>Xoh</i>, or <i>Xo. Ixti ta; xi tacque.</i> As for example.
Sing. <i>Xinloconhi</i>, I have bin loved. <i>Ixtiloconhi</i>, thou hast bin loved. <i>Ixloconhi</i>,
hee hath been loved. Plural. <i>Xoloconhi</i>, wee have been loved. <i>Ixtiloconhita</i>, yee
have been loved. <i>Xiloconhi tacque</i>, they have been loved. <i>Xinrochit</i>, I have been
whipped or beaten. <i>Ixtirochi</i>, thou hast been whipped or beaten. <i>Ixrochi</i>, hee
hath been whipped or beaten. Plural. <i>Xorochi</i>, or <i>xohrochi</i>, we have been whipped
or beaten, <i>Ixtirochita</i>, yee have been whipped or beaten. <i>Xirochi tacque</i>, they
have been whipped or beaten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The Imperative Mood is thus:</p>

<p><i>Tiloconhi</i>, Bee thou loved, <i>Chiloconho</i>, let him bee loved. Plural. <i>Chicaloconho</i>,
let us bee loved, <i>Tiloconhota</i>, bee yee loved, <i>Chiquiloconho tacque</i>, let
them bee loved. Where you see the particle <i>hi</i> is changed into <i>ho</i>.</p>

<p>The Optative Mood, and the Conjunctive are after the manner of the
Verbs Actives, by put to <i>ta</i> in the Optative, and <i>vei</i> in the Conjunctive. As for
example.</p>

<p><i>Quinloconhi ta</i>, I pray God I bee loved. <i>Tiloconhi ta</i>, I pray God thou bee
loved; <i>Inloconhita</i>, I pray God hee be loved; <i>Cohloconhita</i>, I pray God we bee
loved. <i>Tiloconhitata</i>, I pray God yee be loved. <i>Quiloconhi ta tacque</i>, I pray
God they bee loved.</p>

<p>So in the preterperfect tense <i>ta</i> onely is added; as for example.</p>

<p><i>Xinloconhi ta</i>, would to God I have or had been loved. <i>Ixtiloconhita</i>, pray God
thou hast or hadst bin loved, <i>Ixloconhita</i>, pray God he have or had been loved.
Plur. <i>Xoloconhita</i>, pray God we have or had been loved, <i>Ixtiloconhi ta ta</i>, I pray
God ye have or had bin loved, <i>Xiloconhi ta tacque</i>, I pray God they have or had
been loved. Where note that the particle <i>Ta</i>, if any other word or sentence be
put with the Verb, may bee put before the Verb, as <i>Nim ta Quinloconhi</i>, I pray
God I be greatly loved. Otherwise if the Verbe be alone, <i>ta</i> is placed after it.</p>

<p>The Conjunctive Mood is thus, <i>Vei Quinloconhi</i>, if I be loved, <i>Vei tiloconhi</i>,
if thou bee loved, and so forth.</p>

<p>This is all, which commonly is taught concerning this tongue. In which
grounds hee that is perfect in, and hath a Dictionary of the severall words of
it, may soone learn to speake it. As I shall understand by my best friends, that
there is a desire of further printing a Dictionary, I shall satisfie their desires, and
apply my self unto it. These few rules for the present I have thought fit to print,
for curiosity sake, and that it may appear, how easie the <i>Indian</i> tongues are to be
learned. I shall conclude this unparalleld work, with the Lords Prayer in that
tongue, and with a brief explication of it.</p>

<p><i>Catat taxah vilcat; Nimta incaharçihi avi; Inchalita Avihauripan Cana. Invanivita
Nava yahvir vachacal, he invantaxah. Chaye runa cahuhunta quih
viic; Naçachtacamac, he incaçachve quimac ximacquivi chiquih; Macoacana
chipam catacchihi; Coaveçata china unche stiri, mani quiro, he inqui. Amen.</i></p>

<p>Note. <i>Catat</i>, according to the rule of declining Nounes, is the first person
plural, which is known by the particle <i>Ca</i>, added to <i>Tat</i>, which signifieth father;
and <i>Catat</i> is our father.</p>

<p><i>Taxah</i> signifieth heaven; it is put before the word or verb <i>vilcat</i>, for more elegancy
sake, and for better placing of it, contrary to the <i>Latin</i> and <i>English</i>,
where <i>es</i>, and <i>art</i>, is put before <i>in cælis</i>, or in heaven. Likewise it is put without
a preposition, contrary to the Greeke, Latin and English: for in this tongue
many times the prepositions are omitted and understood.</p>

<p><i>Vilcat</i> signifieth <i>es</i> or <i>art</i>: it is the second person of the Verbe, <i>Sum, es, fui,</i>
which is a Verbe Anomal, and not conjugated after the rule of Verbes above.
As for example. <i>Vilquin</i>, I am, <i>Vilcat</i>, thou art, <i>villi</i>, hee is. Plural. <i>Vilcoh</i>, wee
are, <i>Vilcatta</i>, yee are, <i>Vilque tacque</i>, they are. The Preterperfect tence, <i>Xinvi</i>, I
have been, <i>Ixtivi</i>, thou hast been, <i>Ixvi</i>, hee hath been. Plural. <i>Xohvi</i>, we have
been, <i>Ixtivita</i>, yee have been, <i>Xivi tacque</i>, they have been. Imperative. <i>Tivi</i> or
<i>Tivo</i>, bee thou; <i>Chivi</i> or <i>Chivo</i>, let him be. Plural. <i>Cohvi ta</i> or <i>Cohvo ta</i>, let
us bee; <i>Tivita</i> or <i>Tivota</i>, bee yee; <i>Quivi ta</i> or <i>Quivo ta tacque</i>, let them bee.
The Optative and Conjunctive are according to the Rule above, by adding
<i>ta</i> or <i>vei</i>, to the present tense, and preterperfect tense of the Indicative Mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nim ta Incaharcihi</i>, which signifieth, I pray God may be greatly magnified.
<i>Nim</i> signifieth great or greatly. <i>Ta</i> is <i>optantis</i>, or of wishing. <i>Incaharcihi</i>, is
the third person of the Verbe <i>Quincaharcihi</i>, which signifieth to be magnified
or extolled; and is formed according to the rule above, from the active verbe,
<i>Nucaharça</i>, to magnifie or extoll, by changing the last <i>a</i> into <i>ihi</i>, and adding <i>quin</i>
the particle of the passive.</p>

<p><i>Avi</i> thy name. <i>Vi</i>, signifieth name, and according to the rule above for
Nounes beginning with a Consonant <i>a</i> is the particle of the second
person.</p>

<p><i>Inchalita avihauri</i>, let come thy Kingdome, is the proper expression of this
in <i>English. Inchali</i>, is the third person of the Verbe <i>Quinchali</i>, which
signifieth to come. <i>Ta</i> is as before <i>optantis</i>, or of wishing. <i>Ihauri</i> or
<i>Ihauric</i>, signifieth kingdome. <i>Av</i>, added, sheweth the second person.</p>

<p><i>Pan cana</i>, upon our heads. This is a peculiar expression in that tongue;
which (as all other tongues) hath many phrases, strange expressions, proper
elegancies and circumlocutions. Whereof this one, to say, Let thy Kingdome
come upon our heads. <i>Pam</i> or <i>Pan</i>, is a preposition, signifying in or
within, or upon. <i>Na</i> signifieth head; <i>Nuna</i>, my head, <i>Cana</i>, our head, according
to the rule above: from whence they call a hat, <i>Pan Nuna</i>, as being upon
the head.</p>

<p><i>Invanivi ta Nava</i>, let be done what thou wilt. They have no proper Noun
to expresse a mans will, but expresse it by a Verbe: <i>Invanivi</i>, is the third person
of the Verbe, <i>Quinvanivi</i>, which signifieth to be made or done. The
Active is <i>Nuvan</i>, I doe or make: from whence are formed many passives,
as <i>Quinvan</i> or <i>Quinvanhi</i>, or <i>Quinvani</i>, or <i>Quinvanivi</i>, or <i>Quinbanari</i>; or
<i>Quinvantihi</i>, whereof this last signifieth to bee done speedily. And so to
all Verbes Actives and Passives, this particle <i>tihi</i>, is added at the end, to signifie
hast or speed in doing any thing. <i>Nava</i>, is the second person of the Verbe,
<i>Inva</i>, I will, according to the rule for verbes beginning with a vowell, <i>Nava</i>,
thou wilt, <i>Inra</i>, he will.</p>

<p><i>Yahvir vach a cal</i>, here upon the face of the earth; <i>Yahvir</i>, is an Adverbe
signifying here, <i>Vach</i>, signifieth face, <i>Nuvach</i>, my face, <i>Avach</i>, thy face, <i>Ruvach</i>,
his face. <i>Acal</i>, signifieth the earth or ground.</p>

<p><i>He invan taxah</i>, as it is done in heaven. <i>He</i> is an Adverbe, signifying even as,
<i>Invan</i>, is the third person of the passive Verbe, <i>Quinvan</i>, to bee done. <i>Taxah</i>,
as before, signifieth in heaven without any preposition to it.</p>

<p><i>Chaye runa</i>, give to day. <i>Nuye</i> is the first person of the present tense, signifying,
I give, <i>Cha</i>, is the particle (according to the rule above) of the second
person of the Imperative Mood. <i>Chaye</i>, give thou; <i>Chyrue</i>, let him give.
<i>Runa</i>, to day.</p>

<p><i>Cahuhun ta quih viic</i>, our every day bread, where note that <i>ca</i>, put before <i>huhun</i>
is very elegantly placed, though it doe belong to the word <i>viic</i>, which signifieth
bread. <i>Nuviic</i>, my bread, <i>Caviic</i>, our bread. <i>Huhun</i> is an undeclined word,
signifying every one, or every thing. <i>quih</i> signifieth the sun or the day.</p>

<p><i>Naçach ta camac</i>, I pray God thou forgive our sinnes. They use not here the
Imperative Mood, as in <i>Latin demitte</i>, and in <i>English</i> forgive, but with the particle
<i>ta</i>, of wishing, they use the Optative Mood. <i>Naçach</i> is the second person
of the Verbe, <i>Nuçach</i>, I forgive. <i>Mac</i>, signifieth sin. <i>Numac</i>, my sin or sins, <i>camac</i>,
our sins. <i>Laval</i> is another word in that tongue also to signifie sin.</p>

<p><i>He incaçachve quimac</i>, Even as we forgive their sins. <i>Incaçach</i> is the first person
plural, according to the rule above, for verbes beginning with a consonant, <i>ve</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
is put at the end for elegancy sake. <i>Quimac</i> is the third person plural. Where note
that in a whole speech or sentence, sometimes the particle <i>tacque</i>, observed above
in the rule for declining is left out; and sometimes it is added. As here,
<i>quimac</i> their sins; or else it might have been <i>quimac tacque</i>.</p>

<p><i>Xim acquivi chi quih</i>, that have sinned against our backs, of <i>Mac</i>, signifying sin,
is this Verbe formed, <i>quinmacquivi</i>, to sin. So likewise of <i>lavil</i>, sin, is formed another
Verb, <i>quinlavini</i>, to sin. This Verbe <i>quinmacquivi</i> is a Deponent; of
which sort there are many in that tongue, as <i>quincutani</i>, to preach, which have
the same Particles as the Verbes Passives. <i>Chiquih</i> is a word compounded of
the Preposition <i>chi</i> and <i>ih</i>, which signifieth back, and is varied like the Nounes
beginning with a Vowell, and joyned with <i>chi</i>, signifieth against, as <i>Chivih</i>,
against mee, <i>chavih</i>, against thee, <i>chirih</i>, against him. Plural. <i>Chiquih</i>, against
us, <i>chavihta</i>, against yee, <i>chiquih tacque</i>, against them. And if another third
person bee named, <i>chirih</i>, standeth for against, as <i>chirih Pedro</i>, against <i>Peter</i>,
that is, against the back. If many be named in the third person Plural, then <i>chiquih</i>
is used, as <i>chiquih unche</i>, or <i>chiquih cunch elal</i>, against all.</p>

<p><i>Mecoacana</i>, leave us not. This Verbe is here compounded of three: first, <i>Ma</i>,
is abbreviated from the word <i>mani</i>, which signifieth no or not, as likewise <i>manchucu.
Co</i> or <i>coh</i>, signifieth wee or us, and as in the rules before I have observed, is
put here before the Verb; which causeth the <i>n</i> to be cut off from the verb,
which otherwise should have beene <i>nacana</i>, of <i>nucana</i>, I leave, <i>nacana</i>, thou
leavest, <i>inrucana</i>, he leaveth, and so forth.</p>

<p><i>Chipam catacchihi</i>, in our being tempted. This is another great elegancy in
that tongue to use a Verbe Passive for a Noune, and to add to it a Preposition;
as here, <i>chipam</i>, which signifieth in; and putting to the Verbe the Particles
wherewith the Nounes are varied and declined. <i>Nutacchih</i>, signifieth I tempt.
The Passive is <i>quintacchihi</i>, I am tempted; from whence <i>nutacchihi</i>, signifieth
my being tempted, or my temptation; <i>atacchihi</i>, thy temptation, <i>rutacchihi</i>,
his temptation, <i>catacchihi</i>, our temptation.</p>

<p><i>Coaveçata china unche tsiri.</i> Deliver us from all evill things. <i>Inveça</i>, as I have
noted before, signifyeth to deliver. <i>Co</i> is the first person Plural put before the
Verbe, as I observed in the rule above, and in that Conjunction or compound
<i>macoacana. China</i> is a Preposition, signifying above or from. <i>Unche</i>, signifieth
all, which is undeclinable. <i>tsiri</i>, is an Adjective properly undeclinable also or
unvariable, in Gender, Case, and Number; as are all Adjectives in that tongue.
It signifieth evill or bad; as <i>tsiri vinac</i>, an evill man, <i>tsiri ixoc</i>, a bad woman,
<i>tsiri chicop</i>, a bad or evill beast; so likewise in the Plural number it is the same.
Without a Substantive it is as the Newter Gender, as <i>malum</i> for <i>malares</i>, signifying
an evill thing, or evill things. The Substantive that is formed from
it, is <i>tsiriquil</i>, which signifieth evill or wickednesse. <i>Voronquil</i>, signifieth the
same.</p>

<p><i>Mani quiroz</i>, not good: this is put for a further expression of evils to be delivered
from whatsoever is not good. <i>Mani</i>, as I noted before, signifieth not. <i>Quiro</i>, is as
<i>tsiri</i>, an Adjective, signifying good or a good thing, and is undeclinable, unvariable
in both numbers. <i>Quiro vinac</i>, a good man, <i>quiro ixoc</i>, a good woman,
<i>quiro chicop</i>, a good beast; so likewise in the plural number, <i>quiro vinac</i>, good
men. The Substantive that is derived from this Adjective, is, <i>quirohal</i>, goodness.
<i>Chiohal</i>, signifieth the same. <i>quirolah</i>, is very good, <i>tsirilah</i>, very bad, where <i>lah</i> is
added at the end of an adjective, it puts the same aggravation as <i>valde</i> in <i>Latin</i>.</p>

<p><i>He inqui</i>, even as he saith. The meaning is, even as hee saith that taught this
prayer. <i>Quinqui</i>, signifieth I say, <i>tiqui</i>, thou saiest, <i>inqui</i>, hee saith, <i>Cohqui</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
wee say, <i>tiquita</i>, yee say, <i>quiquitacque</i>, they say.</p>

<p><i>Amen</i>. All words which have no true expression in the <i>Indians</i> tongues,
are continued in the <i>Spanish</i>, or in the proper tongue, as here <i>Amen</i>. So wine
which formerly they had not, they call <i>vino</i>; though by an improper word
some call it <i>Castilana ha</i>, that is, the water of Castile. So God, they call <i>Dios</i>
commonly; though some call him <i>Nim Ahval</i>, that is, the great Lord.</p>

<p>And thus for curiosities sake, and by the intreaty of some speciall friends, I
have furnished the Presse with a language which never yet was printed, or
known in <i>England</i>. A Merchant, Mariner, or Captaine at Sea may chance
by fortune to be driven upon some Coast, where he may meet with some <i>Pocoman
Indian</i>; and it may bee of great use to him, to have some light of this
<i>Poconchi</i> tongue. Whereunto I shall be willing hereafter to add something more
for the good of my Countrey; and for the present I leave thee Reader to study
what hitherto hath briefely been delivered by mee.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
